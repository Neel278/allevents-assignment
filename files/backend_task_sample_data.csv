Gentle Kriyas
Somatic &amp; Therapeutic Yoga practice

Self massage, diaphragm &amp; psoas release techniques
Trauma healing &amp; the nervous system
Anatomy of the breath
Jnana Yoga &amp; the 5 Sheaths Kosha

Exactly as the name implies, spring is all about ‘springing’ back to life. The season runs from complete inertia to gradual bloom. The quality of energy is rising, reaching, expanding and flowering, becoming more colorful. It’s about coming out of our dormant form and slowly learning how to express ourselves again. This week teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves, to move slow, to cultivate greater awareness as we integrate into our bodies after a long period of rest, sedentary lifestyle or perhaps even injury.
In the Spring Jnana immersion, the focus and learning outcomes will be centered around super gentle, therapeutic and somatic forms of yoga and kriya practices. Practical sessions will explore the effects of ultra slow movement, shaking and releasing, Zero resistance movements, upa yoga preparations, isolated joint rotations, gentle mobilisation practices and propped and supported asanas allowing us to re-engage our bodies.
We will learn about the nervous system, interoception and the experience of the somatic body, along with somatic trauma healing techniques and how the principles of tracking, resourcing, pendulating, and grounding can be applied in our yoga practice.
Our radical breath recovery series will show you the power of simple breath techniques for recovering the function of the diaphragm, pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. We will have you understand the complex anatomy of the breath and body so that you have an awareness of the implication and effect of certain practices and postures.
We will detail the alignment and technique to be applied in each yoga posture and to see when and how to make adjustments and prop to gain maximum benefit of each asana.
We will introduce the philosophy and history of yoga and align you to its original meaning and purpose so that you can move forth with the correct outlook and intention.
The major theme of the week is self enquiry and re-integrating a deep awareness of everything that makes us human, our body, breath, emotions, mind, intellect, bliss nature and beyond all these sheaths, our eternal self. This season is about reintegration of all our parts.

SUMMER KARMA YOGA COURSE
HIGHLIGHTS:
Advanced abdominal Kriya series
Heating Vinyasa &amp; Ashtanga Yoga
Bodyweight resistance training
How to be strong yet at ease
Vinyasa &amp; Tristana theory
Correct Bandha technique
Yoga Sequencing workshops
Karma yoga
Musculoskeletal Anatomy
Advanced asana workshops
Evening cooling pranayama
Tranquilizing meditation practices
Summer is about being in full swing. You’ve broken out of your shell and you’re exploring what it feels like to shine and enjoy a good challenge. This season is about being at your peak and perhaps even challenging your limit for further expansion. Your body and energy are in good health and together we learn how to stay balanced, at ease and free from injury and burnout by understanding the stress - rest - regenerate cycle and how to move with ease and grace through practice and life challenges.
In the summer Karma immersions, we will move the group towards more heat generating practices with larger compound movements and greater emphasis on sun salutation and strengthening vinyasa practices, guiding students to align their movement with a clear awareness of the breath and its importance in practice, giving them insight into the need for breath moderation in order to understand that breath maintenance is central to maintaining steadiness and ease in the physical, mental and energetic body.
We will also introduce you to the practice of body weight resistance training and its important role in increasing strength and functionality of muscle mass for maintenance of longevity of life.
We move into our advanced abdominal kriya series, detailing the precise technique and preparatory phases required to enter safely and effectively into these practices. Practices include Kapalabhati, Agnisar, Uddiyana kriya, Bhastrika, Nauli and correct application of Bandha.
We will learn the subtle art of transitioning between postures, linking poses, sequencing and forming balanced, safe and invigorating practices for ourselves and students. We explore various class themes and how to break down and prepare the body gradually for advanced postures. Students will explore more advanced asana workshops in this week, including inversions, arm balances, balancing postures, and deeper forward and backbends.
The major theme of this week is Yoga in action, Karma Yoga. Following deep self enquiry, we can begin to look at how our beliefs, views, attitude, decisions, actions and our overall Bhava (way of being) in the moment, governs and transforms our karmic cycles and determines whether we subdue or harden the binds of samsara.
AUTUMN BHAKTI YOGA COURSE
HIGHLIGHTS:
Calming Balancing Pranayama
Restorative Yin Yoga
Combining Yin Yang yoga practice
Yin Yang Theory &amp; Daoism
The Three Pillars of Yin
Interoception &amp; Vagal Toning
Myofascia &amp; meridian theory
Emotions and TCM theory
Bhakti Yoga &amp; Devotional Kirtan
Yin asana alignment &amp; propping
Japa Mantra &amp; sound meditations
Exploration true surrender &amp; Ishvara Pranidhana
Also known as fall, Autumn signals the passing of ripeness and the dropping of fruit. The hard work is complete and we are encouraged to sit back and enjoy the rewards. Yet many of us struggle to let go, to surrender. We move from one achievement to the next, addicted to the busyness of life. Maybe you’re suffering from repeated injuries, fatigue, stress, burnout or insomnia. You can’t seem to get yourself out of the rat race, out of your own incessant activity. This is the season for you.
In the Autumn Bhakti immersion, we start to unwind and shift to the opposite paradigm in the art of surrender. In this busy modern world, such a simple nourishing instinct has been somewhat paralysed in most, with many people moving around in a chronic state of sympathetic overdrive, leading to eventual burnout and a lot of complex stress related metabolic disorders.
This week students will move into the Yin phase of the program where they discover a completely different approach to yoga asana. One that is fully supported, pacifying, yielding, calming and cooling. This week marks the shift and reversal in direction of the consciousness back inward towards its centre. Students will experience how creative and suggestive language, tone, pace of voice and orientation of the teacher can support pratyahara, deeply hypnotic, and restoring states, allowing breath and body to drop back towards its parasympathetic orientation.
We will enter more deeply into the calming, cooling, introverting and balancing pranayama practices to bring about inner relaxation and grounding.
Students will learn about the theory and foundations of Yin Yoga, fascia and the myofascial meridians and how emotions and memories are generated and stored in the body according to traditional chinese medicine.
This is also our week of understanding the theme of Bhakti yoga, because devotion profoundly opens the heart and surrenders the ego to something greater than itself. Through chanting, kirtan and sound healing we further develop our capacity to expand our receptivity and listen more deeply within.

WINTER RAJA YOGA COURSE
HIGHLIGHTS:
Breath elongation &amp; Kumbhaka
Traditional Hatha Practices
Chakra theory &amp; sadhana
Mudra
Dharana meditations
Longer Periods Mindful Silence
Digital Detox
Raja Yoga and Patanjai Sutras
Reflection on Buddhist Philosophy
Silent walking meditation
Winter marks the end of fall. All has released, transformed and dissolved back into the ground, ready to reinvent the wheel. It marks the end of the cycle and a return to deep sleep, restfulness, stillness and inner quietude. Winter is about bringing our physical, mental, emotional and energetic cycles to an end so that a new rebirth can arise. We must allow ourselves to enter into the void so that our entire system can achieve a healthy reboot. We enter winter each night in our few hours of deep sleep; slumbering in emptiness the subtlest sheath of our being.
In our culminating week of Winter Raja, we enter into a silence within ourselves, a state of voidness, quiet presence, exploring meditation and concentration practices that move us through the samyama of Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. We will guide the breath and pranayama practices in a manner that will lead to tranquillity, internalisation and one pointedness of mind, through an intuitive quietening and lengthening of exhalation and the approach to effortless breath suspension.
Our morning asana practice will explore a more meditative and stillness approach to asana, reflecting quietly on our energy body as we move through the theme of our chakras and the teachings and practices around chakra awareness and healing. We will also experience the use of Mudras, bodily gestures and the effect they have on our energy system, emotions and the state of our mind.
This week we go deeper into the Yoga Sutras of Sage Patanjali and his eight limbs of practice leading to liberation and reflect on how it can be applied to our everyday lives.
This week will have more time for silent reflection, silent walks, yoga nidra and meditation together.

PROGRAM ELEMENTS
All of our programs incorporate the following curriculum components:
GUIDED PRACTICE
Experience is the best practice as students get to move through the real time application of yoga techniques and come to know the effect on their own body. Each day we have three sessions dedicated to guiding different components of the practices including breathing and Kriyas, movement based asana practices and meditation, relaxation and devotional practices.
TECHNIQUE AND TRAINING
In these in depth workshops, the skill and techniques in applying certain practices and asana alignment modification, adjustment and propping techniques will be shared with more hands on demonstration and group interaction so that students can learn and assimilate a greater understanding and apply it in their practice.
ANATOMY PHYSIOLOGY THEORY
Each day will contain practical applicable anatomy golden nuggets with the help of pictures, illustrations and demonstrations, to really show students what is under their skin in order to facilitate a greater awareness of what is happening as we move through our practice.
PHILOSOPHY AND THEORIES OF YOGA
These sessions will dive deep into the history and background of Yoga, discuss the meaning of Yoga and delineate essential yogic concepts in the study of Key texts such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Bhagavad Gita.
TEACHING METHODOLOGY
These workshops will be part theory and part practical and help prepare students to be the best teachers possible and highlight key skills they can develop such as preparing and sequencing classes, voice, language and expression, building rapport and congruence, class set up, moving around the room, demonstration skills, verbal and physical hands on assists, and more.
TEACHING PRACTICUMS
This is the opportunity for students and those serious about teaching to get stuck in an just start trying to teach. We do this from our very first day with non intimidating mini tasks to slowly ease you into the flow of teaching and getting use to being seen and heard and building rapport with students. This is where you can start to play and explore your own unique approach to sharing your practice.
STUDENTS SELF STUDY, REFLECTION AND INTEGRATION
This is a really important time for students to reflect and read up on what has been taught throughout the course and a chance for you to organize your notes, consolidate your understanding and even begin preparing some ideas and practices of your own to share with the group.

The students will be taught the philosophy, science, and practices of hatha yoga, breathing awareness and pranayamas, subtle body relaxations, and meditation. Ancient scriptures including selected Prakarana Granthas, selected sections of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, the Samkhya darshana, and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali will be taught. All students will also be taught Sanskrit and Vedic Chantings.

ABOUT OUR UNIQUE YOGA SEASONS...

SPRING JNANA YOGA COURSE
HIGHLIGHTS:

Radical breath recovery series
Gentle Kriyas
Somatic &amp; Therapeutic Yoga practice
Yoga alignment workshops
Self massage, diaphragm &amp; psoas release techniques
Trauma healing &amp; the nervous system
Anatomy of the breath
Jnana Yoga &amp; the 5 Sheaths Kosha
Dynamic meditations
Yoga Nidra

Exactly as the name implies, spring is all about ‘springing’ back to life. The season runs from complete inertia to gradual bloom. The quality of energy is rising, reaching, expanding and flowering, becoming more colorful. It’s about coming out of our dormant form and slowly learning how to express ourselves again. This week teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves, to move slow, to cultivate greater awareness as we integrate into our bodies after a long period of rest, sedentary lifestyle or perhaps even injury.

In the Spring Jnana immersion, the focus and learning outcomes will be centered around super gentle, therapeutic and somatic forms of yoga and kriya practices. Practical sessions will explore the effects of ultra slow movement, shaking and releasing, Zero resistance movements, upa yoga preparations, isolated joint rotations, gentle mobilisation practices and propped and supported asanas allowing us to re-engage our bodies.

We will learn about the nervous system, interoception and the experience of the somatic body, along with somatic trauma healing techniques and how the principles of tracking, resourcing, pendulating, and grounding can be applied in our yoga practice.

Our radical breath recovery series will show you the power of simple breath techniques for recovering the function of the diaphragm, pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. We will have you understand the complex anatomy of the breath and body so that you have an awareness of the implication and effect of certain practices and postures.

We will detail the alignment and technique to be applied in each yoga posture and to see when and how to make adjustments and prop to gain maximum benefit of each asana.
We will introduce the philosophy and history of yoga and align you to its original meaning and purpose so that you can move forth with the correct outlook and intention.

The major theme of the week is self enquiry and re-integrating a deep awareness of everything that makes us human, our body, breath, emotions, mind, intellect, bliss nature and beyond all these sheaths, our eternal self. This season is about reintegration of all our parts.


SUMMER KARMA YOGA COURSE
HIGHLIGHTS:

Advanced abdominal Kriya series
Heating Vinyasa &amp; Ashtanga Yoga
Bodyweight resistance training
How to be strong yet at ease
Vinyasa &amp; Tristana theory
Correct Bandha technique
Yoga Sequencing workshops
Karma yoga
Musculoskeletal Anatomy
Advanced asana workshops
Evening cooling pranayama
Tranquilizing meditation practices

Summer is about being in full swing. You’ve broken out of your shell and you’re exploring what it feels like to shine and enjoy a good challenge. This season is about being at your peak and perhaps even challenging your limit for further expansion. Your body and energy are in good health and together we learn how to stay balanced, at ease and free from injury and burnout by understanding the stress - rest - regenerate cycle and how to move with ease and grace through practice and life challenges.

In the summer Karma immersions, we will move the group towards more heat generating practices with larger compound movements and greater emphasis on sun salutation and strengthening vinyasa practices, guiding students to align their movement with a clear awareness of the breath and its importance in practice, giving them insight into the need for breath moderation in order to understand that breath maintenance is central to maintaining steadiness and ease in the physical, mental and energetic body. 

We will also introduce you to the practice of body weight resistance training and its important role in increasing strength and functionality of muscle mass for maintenance of longevity of life.

We move into our advanced abdominal kriya series, detailing the precise technique and preparatory phases required to enter safely and effectively into these practices. Practices include Kapalabhati, Agnisar, Uddiyana kriya, Bhastrika, Nauli and correct application of Bandha.

We will learn the subtle art of transitioning between postures, linking poses, sequencing and forming balanced, safe and invigorating practices for ourselves and students. We explore various class themes and how to break down and prepare the body gradually for advanced postures. Students will explore more advanced asana workshops in this week, including inversions, arm balances, balancing postures, and deeper forward and backbends.

The major theme of this week is Yoga in action, Karma Yoga. Following deep self enquiry, we can begin to look at how our beliefs, views, attitude, decisions, actions and our overall Bhava (way of being) in the moment, governs and transforms our karmic cycles and determines whether we subdue or harden the binds of samsara.

Also known as fall, Autumn signals the passing of ripeness and the dropping of fruit. The hard work is complete and we are encouraged to sit back and enjoy the rewards. Yet many of us struggle to let go, to surrender. We move from one achievement to the next, addicted to the busyness of life. Maybe you’re suffering from repeated injuries, fatigue, stress, burnout or insomnia. You can’t seem to get yourself out of the rat race, out of your own incessant activity. This is the season for you.

In the Autumn Bhakti immersion, we start to unwind and shift to the opposite paradigm in the art of surrender. In this busy modern world, such a simple nourishing instinct has been somewhat paralysed in most, with many people moving around in a chronic state of sympathetic overdrive, leading to eventual burnout and a lot of complex stress related metabolic disorders.
This week students will move into the Yin phase of the program where they discover a completely different approach to yoga asana. One that is fully supported, pacifying, yielding, calming and cooling. This week marks the shift and reversal in direction of the consciousness back inward towards its centre. Students will experience how creative and suggestive language, tone, pace of voice and orientation of the teacher can support pratyahara, deeply hypnotic, and restoring states, allowing breath and body to drop back towards its parasympathetic orientation.

We will enter more deeply into the calming, cooling, introverting and balancing pranayama practices to bring about inner relaxation and grounding.
Students will learn about the theory and foundations of Yin Yoga, fascia and the myofascial meridians and how emotions and memories are generated and stored in the body according to traditional chinese medicine.

This is also our week of understanding the theme of Bhakti yoga, because devotion profoundly opens the heart and surrenders the ego to something greater than itself. Through chanting, kirtan and sound healing we further develop our capacity to expand our receptivity and listen more deeply within.


WINTER RAJA YOGA COURSE

Breath elongation &amp; Kumbhaka
Traditional Hatha Practices
Chakra theory &amp; sadhana
Mudra
Dharana meditations
Longer Periods Mindful Silence
Digital Detox
Raja Yoga and Patanjai Sutras
Reflection on Buddhist Philosophy
Silent walking meditation

Winter marks the end of fall. All has released, transformed and dissolved back into the ground, ready to reinvent the wheel. It marks the end of the cycle and a return to deep sleep, restfulness, stillness and inner quietude. Winter is about bringing our physical, mental, emotional and energetic cycles to an end so that a new rebirth can arise. We must allow ourselves to enter into the void so that our entire system can achieve a healthy reboot. We enter winter each night in our few hours of deep sleep; slumbering in emptiness the subtlest sheath of our being.

In our culminating week of Winter Raja, we enter into a silence within ourselves, a state of voidness, quiet presence, exploring meditation and concentration practices that move us through the samyama of Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. We will guide the breath and pranayama practices in a manner that will lead to tranquillity, internalisation and one pointedness of mind, through an intuitive quietening and lengthening of exhalation and the approach to effortless breath suspension.

Our morning asana practice will explore a more meditative and stillness approach to asana, reflecting quietly on our energy body as we move through the theme of our chakras and the teachings and practices around chakra awareness and healing. We will also experience the use of Mudras, bodily gestures and the effect they have on our energy system, emotions and the state of our mind.
This week we go deeper into the Yoga Sutras of Sage Patanjali and his eight limbs of practice leading to liberation and reflect on how it can be applied to our everyday lives.

This week will have more time for silent reflection, silent walks, yoga nidra and meditation together.

PROGRAM ELEMENTS

All of our programs incorporate the following curriculum components:

GUIDED PRACTICE
Experience is the best practice as students get to move through the real time application of yoga techniques and come to know the effect on their own body. Each day we have three sessions dedicated to guiding different components of the practices including breathing and Kriyas, movement based asana practices and meditation, relaxation and devotional practices.

TECHNIQUE AND TRAINING
In these in depth workshops, the skill and techniques in applying certain practices and asana alignment modification, adjustment and propping techniques will be shared with more hands on demonstration and group interaction so that students can learn and assimilate a greater understanding and apply it in their practice.

ANATOMY PHYSIOLOGY THEORY
Each day will contain practical applicable anatomy golden nuggets with the help of pictures, illustrations and demonstrations, to really show students what is under their skin in order to facilitate a greater awareness of what is happening as we move through our practice.

PHILOSOPHY AND THEORIES OF YOGA
These sessions will dive deep into the history and background of Yoga, discuss the meaning of Yoga and delineate essential yogic concepts in the study of Key texts such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Bhagavad Gita.

TEACHING METHODOLOGY
These workshops will be part theory and part practical and help prepare students to be the best teachers possible and highlight key skills they can develop such as preparing and sequencing classes, voice, language and expression, building rapport and congruence, class set up, moving around the room, demonstration skills, verbal and physical hands on assists, and more.

TEACHING PRACTICUMS
This is the opportunity for students and those serious about teaching to get stuck in an just start trying to teach. We do this from our very first day with non intimidating mini tasks to slowly ease you into the flow of teaching and getting use to being seen and heard and building rapport with students. This is where you can start to play and explore your own unique approach to sharing your practice.

STUDENTS SELF STUDY, REFLECTION AND INTEGRATION
This is a really important time for students to reflect and read up on what has been taught throughout the course and a chance for you to organize your notes, consolidate your understanding and even begin preparing some ideas and practices of your own to share with the group.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events5/banners/6aadcba315373f93033bd293bd03597b1dcdd46cb55e6152f243411ec0e99bab-rimg-w960-h563-gmir.jpg?v=1656119382",54.920,"health-wellness,workshops,meditation,yoga,art,sports,trips-adventures"

In the era of digital transformation, automation is everything. The technology building blocks of a digital organization, such as Internet of Things, cloud computing, and mobility, are all reliant on the network. If the network is slow, it will stall your digital transformation, but intelligent network automation will propel you forward and help you thrive. Network automation is the process to plan, deploy, configure, orchestrate and assure networks and services using software. Network automation is increasingly required to manage the complexities of modern, dynamic networks and to orchestrate services in an efficient and effective manner.

The end goal of network automation is to create”zero-touch” or autonomous networks. In the interim implementation of automation in 5G networks addresses three key operational issues facing telecom operators today.

Reduction of human errors in network management and operations
Reduction of service provisioning time and improve time-to-cash
Reduction in time-to-resolve network and security issues through closed-loop network assurance
Currently Telecom Operators networks are becoming dynamic and heterogeneous. The requirement to constantly change network parameters and configurations to meet customer expectations creates huge amounts of complexity. The flexibility of 5G networks makes efficient network operation without high levels of automation impractical. Automation improves every aspect of service provider operations.

If Telecom Operators want to unlock the full potential of future 5G networks, they need automation. Automation reduces error in network operations and service management and accelerates tasks.

At this event – We take this opportunity to invite all stakeholders to come forward and participate at this event to understand the collective needs of Network Automation for Telecom Operators. The event is committed to provide complete 360 degree view of Network Automation progress in India.

This platform will bring together industry top executives to discuss and deliberate on Network Automation.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/f4dfbec1d85e4fe666c3325b1cfe47cf2a776229a80f8297d620803a2ffcbf47-rimg-w960-h614-gmir.jpg?v=1656014493",72.440,"it"

Complete Immersive Sensory Experience
Not for the faint-hearted
*Trigger Warning - Stories of Sexual assault*
A complete immersive sensory experience performance art piece produced by Rangaai Theatre company, designed and directed by Tushar T. Dalvi. He is also known for his critically acclaimed play The Darkroom 2.0 - An immersive sensory experience show, which has done the most number of shows in intimate independent theatre category and has also been rated 4 stars by Times of India. Rangaai Theatre company is the only immersive sensory experience theatre company in Mumbai. 

UNTITLED is a narration of true stories and a presentation of the shocking reality of society. The piece intends on showing an audience member the terrifying ordeal that rape victims are put through by gruesome acts of the administration, political system as well as their communities. It raises questions on the normalization of a rape culture and the social stigma that is attached to it.

You will be made to experience the horror of the power play, that rape perpetrates, by being thrown into the same situations as those victimized. You will not just be watching the play but living it through performance. This will be achieved by intruding into one's private space and taking control of their experiences by delivering emotions such as disgust, anguish, and guilt. All of this in a hope that you are outraged enough to channelize that rage into some tangible results helping overcome the rape crisis that our country is facing.

Through this performance art piece, we aim to educate, encourage and sensitize our audiences towards this growing issue. We'll also guide you to form and join a league of changemakers by involving a forum platform to ideate, share skills and knowledge to collaborate for a change.

The performance piece will compromise 4 true stories where the audience will play the role of bystanders to the incidents. It will be executed in an immersive sensory experience format, which means, you will have to trust our expertise and surrender to the art. We may put you into uncomfortable positions and scenarios which have intricately been designed to elevate your experience.

Where the thrill of uncertainty and unknowing is implicated by the blindfolds. Upon arrival, while you are still kept blindfolded you are greeted with characters from story whispering in your ears. It is said a scent can bring back some memories and so we expose you with some scents distinctively from each story. You are also given the power to decide the faith of the characters from the story. Whereas at times they themselves invite you to their stories. They become your friends and share some jokes and stories with you. And finally, they mix so well with you that the line between the actor and the character is blurred and you are transferred to a virtual reality.

All this, to only create a unique experience for you where they strive to make it worth every penny for the audience.

So, if you are as ready to experience Dark and Immersive Theatre for stories as woeful and the world shuffled upside down for stepping into a postmodernist journey of expressions and reactions then, Rangaai Theatre Company invites you to The Darkroom 2.0!

Stories:
Durga Poojo (A True Story) - Anonymous (Trigger Warning) 
Kafan (1936) - Munshi Premchand
Khol Do (1952) - Saadat Hasan Manto.


Note:
Guests have to arrive 20 minutes before the show time

This might seem like daydreaming rather than reality. Isn't it amazing that you can now watch movies and even join meetings online, as well as change the lights based on your mood because of the internet? It wouldn't have made sense a few years ago, but today, it's the norm with help of IoT.
IoT makes virtually everything “smart,” by improving aspects of our life with the power of data collection, AI algorithms, and networks. The goal of IoT is to extend internet connectivity to \"dumb\" devices like toasters and turn them into \"smart\" devices. Such devices are basically lazy as a standard device needs to be switched on but as Frank B. Gilbreth Sr once said, “I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.” We now have smart kitchen, smart vacuums and etc.

iFour Technolab will be conducting a meetup for IoT.
Date: 25th June, 2022, Saturday
Time : 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM
Venue: 601, The Times Square Arcade, Near Baghban party plot, Thaltej-Shilaj Road, Ahmedabad

-દર વર્ષની જેમ આ ‌વખતે પણ જગન્નાથની ભવ્યાતિભવ્ય રથયાત્રા નીકળશે અષાઢ ને કારણે વધુ લોકો જોડાશે. (દિલિપદાસજી મહારાજ, જગન્નાથ મંદિરના મહંત )
-આઝાદીના સમય પહેલા જ્યારે ભગવાન જગન્નાથની રથયાત્રા નીકળે ત્યારે શહેરીજનો તિરંગો ફરકાવતા હતા.
-બળદગાડાથી શરૂ થયેલી રથયાત્રા હાઇટેક બની, પ્રારંભથી જ ખલાસ કોમના ભાઈઓ રથ ખેંચતા આવ્યા

૧૮૭૬ માં મહામંડળેશ્વર નૃસિંહદાસજીએ સ્વપ્નમાં સ્વયં ભગવાને આપેલા આદેશને માથે ચડાવીને રથયાત્રાનો પ્રારંભ કરાવ્યો હતો એ પછી દર વર્ષે અષાઢી બીજે અમદાવાદમાં જગન્નાથ ભગવાનની રથયાત્રા યોજાતી રહી છે, આટલા વર્ષો પછી આજેય રથયાત્રામાં ભક્તિ અને શ્રદ્ધાનું ઘોડાપૂર યથાવત રહ્યું છે. દરેક ધર્મના લોકો ભક્તિભાવપૂર્વક અને રંગેચંગે ભગવાનને આવકારતા રહ્યા છે. વર્ષમાં માત્ર આ એક દિવસે ભક્તોને દર્શન આપવા માટે ભગવાન સામે ચાલીને આવે છે. ૧૪૩ વર્ષથી ચાલી આવતી આ પરપંરાના અતિતનીઝાંખી કરાવતો આ વિશેષ અહેવાલ...
 
અમદાવાદ : લગભગ ચારસો વર્ષ પહેલાં રામાનંદી સંત શ્રી હનુમાનજીદાસજીએ આજના જગન્નાથજીના મંદિરમાં પોતાની ગાદીની સ્થાપના કરી હતી. એમના પછી ગાદીએ આવેલા સારંગદાસજીએ જગન્નાથજી, બળદેવજી અને દેવી સુભદ્રાજીની મૂર્તિઓ મંગાવીને સ્થાપના કરાવી ત્યારથી જ આ મંદિર ‘જગન્નાથજીની મંદિર’ તરીકે જગપ્રસિદ્ધ થયું. એમના પછી બાલમુકુંદદાસજી આવ્યા અને તે પછી
નરસિંહદાસજી આવ્યા.નરસિંહદાસજીને સ્વપ્નમાં ભગવાન જગન્નાથજી આવ્યા અને તેમણે રથયાત્રા શરૂ કરી. લોકવાયકાઓ અનુસાર  ભરૂચમાં રહેતા ખલાસ કોમના ભક્તોએ પણ રથયાત્રાની પોતાની જવાબદારી સ્વીકારી લીધી. તેમણે તાબડતોબ નરિયેળના ઝાડમાંથી ત્રણે ભગવાનના રથ તૈયાર કરીને અમદાવાદ પહોંચાડી દીધા.

આમ ૧૮૭૬ થી શરૂ થયેલી રથયાત્રામાં પરંપરા મુજબ રથ ખેંચવાનું કાર્ય ખલાસ કોમના ભાઇઓ સાચી શ્રદ્ધાથી દર વર્ષે કરે છે. ૧૪૪ વર્ષ પહેલા શરૂ થયેલી રથયાત્રામાંઉત્તરોત્તર મોટી થતી ગઇ.  શરૂઆતમાં માત્ર સાધુ-સંતો જ રથયાત્રામાં ભાગ લેતા હતા અને તેમનું રસોડું સરસપુરના રણછોડજી મંદિરમાં રાખવામાં આવતું, ભક્તજનોની ભીડ વધતા  સરસપુરમાં ઠેર ઠેર રસોડાંઓ ઊભાં કરવામાં આવ્યાં. દર વર્ષે મામેરું પણ અહીંયા જ કરાય છે નરસિંહદાસજી મહારાજે પ્રથમવાર કાઢેલી રથયાત્રા વખતે ભગવાનને બળદગાડામાં બિરાજમાન કરવામાં આવ્યા હતાં. ત્યારથી લઇને આજ સુધીમાં રથયાત્રા ઐતિહાસીકથી મોર્ડન બની ગઇ છે.

માત્ર રથયાત્રા જ નહી પણ જે રથમાં ભગવાનબિરાજીને નગરચર્યાએ નીકળે છે તેણે પણ હવે નવા રૂપરંગ હાંસલ કરી લીધા છે. રથ નવા રૂપ રંગ ધારણ કર્યા છે સાથોસાથ તેમાં મોર્ડન પૈડા અને સ્ટીંયરીંગ પણ લગાડવામાં આવે છે. શરૂઆતની  યાત્રામાં ગણ્યાગાંઠ્યા પોલિસ કર્મીઓ હતા હવે રથયાત્રામાં શ્રદ્ધાળુઓ કરતા પોલીસ વધારે હોય તેવી લોકોમાં ચર્ચા હોય છે. સહજતાથી ભગવાનની સમીપ જતો ભક્ત હવે રથની નજીક જતા પણ બીતો થઇ ગયો છે.
 
ગાડાથી ટ્રક સુધી:  અત્યારની રથયાત્રા હાઇટેક બની ગઈ છે જ્યારે ૧૯૫૨ ની રથયાત્રાની આ તસવીર રસપ્રદ છે, એ વખતે બળદો દ્વારા યાત્રાના વાહનો ખેંચવામાં આવતા હતા.
રથયાત્રામાં સાહસિક કરતબો કરતા પહેલવાનો આકર્ષણનું કેન્દ્ર હોય છે.
 
૨૦૦૫ માં રથયાત્રા દરમિયાન ક્રાઇમ બ્રાંચના જાંબાઝ અધિકારીઓએ ચાલુ યાત્રાએ સફળ ઓપરેશન કરીને અતિ સંવેદનશીલ એવા શાહપુર વિસ્તારના શાહપુર અડ્ડા પાસેથી ઘાતક હથીયારોનો જંગી જથ્થો પકડી પાડતા મોટી ઘાત ટાળી શકાઈ હતી.
અત્યાર સુધી સૌથી વધુ ૧૨ વખત પહિંદ વિધિ કરવાનો નરેન્દ્ર મોદીનો વિક્રમ
 
ભગવાન જગનાથની જ્યારે નગર ચર્યા માટે નીકળે ત્યારે રાજા તેમનો રસ્તો સાફ કરવા માટે આવે છે તેવી લોકવાયકા અને પરંપરા પુરીમાં ચાલે છે. આથી અમદાવાદની રથયાત્રામાં પણ આ પહિંદ વિધિ યોજવામાં આવે છે. જેમાં રાજ્યના મુખ્યમંત્રી સોનાની સાવરણી લઇને ભગવાનનો રસ્તો સાફ કરે છે. સૌથી વધુ વખત પહિંદ વિધિ કરવાનો રેકોર્ડ હાલમાં દેશના વડાપ્રધાન બનેલા નરેન્દ્ર મોદીનો છે. તેમણે સતત ૧૨ વર્ષ સુધી જગન્નાથમંદિરની રથયાત્રાની પહિંદ વિધિ કરી હતી. 
-જગન્નાથની રથયાત્રાની પ્રાચીન પરંપરા કોમી એખલાસનું પ્રતીક છે. લાખો શ્રદ્ધાળુઓ જગન્નાથના દર્શન કરીને ધન્યતા અનુભવે છે. તેમના આશીર્વાદ મેળવીને પોતાની જાતને પાવન માને છે.  (નરેન્દ્ર મોદી પહિંદવિધિ દરમિયાન)
 
અત્યાર સુધીના મહંત

ફેક્ટ ફાઇલ
 
રથયાત્રાના શરૂઆતના વર્ષોમાં માત્ર સાધુસંતો જ ભાગ લેતા હતા  જ્યારે હવે માત્ર અમદાવાદના જ નહીં પણ દેશભરના શ્રદ્ધાળુઓ ઉમટે છે. 

     જગન્નાથ મંદિરના પ્રથમ મહંત અને રથયાત્રાના પ્રેરક નરસિંહદાસજી મહારાજ જગનનાથ ભગવાનના સૌથી મોટા ભક્ત હતા. તેઓ વર્ષો સુધી ગુજરાતથીઓરિસ્સામાં  આવેલા જગન્નાથ મંદિરે ઉઘાડા પગે ચાલતા જતા હતા. આ ભક્તિથી જગન્નાથ પ્રસન્ન થયા હતા અને તેમને સ્વપ્નમાં આવીને યાત્રા શરૂ કરવાની પ્રેરણા આપી  હતી.
 
રથનો મનોરથ | નરસિંહદાસજી મહારાજે શહેરીજનોના દર્શનાર્થે અમદાવાદમાં રથયાત્રાનો પ્રારંભ કરાવ્યો હતો,અને આજે દાયકાઓ પછી પણ આ પરંપરા આજ સુધી યથાવત રહી છે. દર વર્ષે દર્શનાર્થીઓની સંખ્યામાં સતત વધારો થતો રહ્યો છે.
કાલી રોટી સફેદ દાલ: ૧૯૫૮ ની રથયાત્રા દરમ્યાન દેશભરમાંથી ઉમટેલા સાધુસંતોનો ભંડારો.
 
૧૯૬૪ અવિરત યાત્રા: આજે જ્વલ્લેજ જોવા મળતી
સરહદના ગાંધી રથયાત્રાની મુલાકાતે
૧૯૭૬ માં ખાન અબ્દુલ ગફાર ખાને રથયાત્રાની મુલાકાત  લીધી હતી અને સાધુગણને મળ્યા હતા.

મંદિરના પ્રિય હાથી સરજુ પ્રસાદની સમાધિ આસ્થાનું કેન્દ્
જગન્નાથ મંદિરના હાથીઓની સાથે મંદિરમાં બીજા અખાડાઓના મહંતો પણ પોતાના હાથીઓ મંદિરની સેવામાં આપે છે. તેવો જ એક હાથી સરજુ પ્રસાદ હતો. સરજુ પ્રસાદ મંદિરના તમામ સંતો-મહંતો અને લોકોનો માનીતો હતો. રથયાત્રામાં સૌથી આગળ તે ભાગ લેતો અને તેણે સૌથી વધારે વખત રથયાત્રામાં ભાગ પણ લીધો હતો. હાથી સરજુ પ્રસાદનું જ્યારે અવસાન થયુ ત્યારે આખા મંદિરમાં શોકની લાગણી વ્યાપી ગઇ હતી. આથી તે સમયના લોકોએ આ હાથીની સમાધિ બનાવવાનું નક્કી કર્યુ. તે સમયેરસપ્તઋષિ સ્મશાન રોડ પરની કેલિકોમીલની પાછળ આવેલી ખુલ્લી જગ્યામાં તેની સમાધિ બનાવવામાં આવી. ત્યારથી આ સમાધિ લોકોની આસ્થાનું કેન્દ્ર બન્યું છે.
                   
મોટીસંખ્યામાં લોકો આ “સરજુ પ્રસાદ”ની સમાધિના દર્શન કરવા જાય છે. આ સમાધિની ઉપર ભગવાન ગણેશજીની પ્રતિમાનું સ્થાપન કરવામાં આવ્યું છે. તેની આસપાસ રહેતા મુસ્લિમ સમાજના લોકો પણ તેમા આસ્થા રાખે છે. ૧૪૩ વર્ષ પહેલા  ૧૮૭૬ માં અમદાવાદમાં રથયાત્રાનો પ્રારંભ થયો. મહામંડળેશ્વર નૃસિંહદાસજીએ આ પવિત્રરથયાત્રાની શરૂઆત કરી હતી. જે પ્રથા આજે પણ અવિરત ચાલી રહી છે. જગન્નાથજીનું મંદિરથી નિકળતી રથયાત્રામાં અમદાવાદના જ નહીં પણ ચારે કોરના લોકો શ્રદ્ધા-ભક્તિ સાથે ઉમટી પડે છે.

    
૧૯૯૬ ખલાસીઓનું સમર્પણ | દરિયાપાર હોય કે દેશદેશાવર, ખલાસીઓ અચૂકપણે ડર અષાઢી બીજે ભગવાનના રથને ગંતવ્ય સ્થાને પહોંચાડવા હાજર થઈ જાય છે.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/29ce41d41c2aa48d00b595a6de11208c010ffbaf49dc752ed6ab73582927b39d-rimg-w960-h540-gmir.jpg?v=1656063029",20.800,""

Lashlifting ist neben der Wimpernverlängerung auch eine der beliebtesten Beautytrends. Für diese Schulung gibt es keine Voraussetzungen und ganz egal ob du aus der Beauty Branche kommst oder du einfach als Quereinsteiger oder Anfänger in der Beauty Welt Fuß fassen möchtest, diese Schulung ist für dich super geeignet.

Auf dem deutschen Markt gibt es immer mehr Beauty Bars, die Lash &amp; Brow Lifting anbieten, und alleine durch diese zwei Behandlungen umsatzstark profitieren. Auch als Zusatzleistung z.B beim Friseur, im Nagelstudio, in Sonnenstudios oder andernorts sind diese zwei Trendbehandlungen ein profitables Zusatzgeschäft. Wir zeigen dir, wie du die Naturwimpern deiner Kundinnen dunkler, länger und voller aussehen lassen kannst – ganz ohne Wimpernverlängerung und ohne Wimpernzange. Eine Behandlung in deinem Studio dauert ca. eine Stunde und ist eine gute Alternative zur Wimpernverlängerung. Sie eignet sich zudem hervorragend für all diejenigen, die aufgrund einer Allergie keine Wimpernverlängerung tragen können. Dies ist somit ein guter Nebenverdienst, ohne großen Aufwand. Nach einem ausführlichen theoretischen Teil arbeitest du an einem Modell um das Erlernte optimal zu vertiefen.

An dieser Trendbehandlung kommst du zurzeit nicht vorbei ￼ Das Brow Lifting ist der absolute Renner. Folgende Benefits bringt es mit sich:

 Es verleiht den Augenbrauen mehr Fülle

Optisch mehr Volumen

Haltbarkeit bis zu 8 Wochen

Brows on Fleek – Und das den ganzen Tag

Ein absolutes Muss für all diejenigen, die neue Kunden gewinnen möchten. Nicht nur der Effekt für die Kundin ist sehenswert, auch dein Nutzen als Stylist/in ist nicht zu unterschätzen. Eine Behandlungsdauer von etwa einer halben Stunde macht die Anwendung super profitabel. Du hast die Möglichkeit an diesem Tag auch die Kenntnisse des Brow Liftings zu erwerben. Der Aufpreis für diese Schulung liegt bei 100 Euro.

Solltest Du dich dafür entscheiden, dann teile uns das einfach per E-Mail mit.

Путешествие, которое может изменить вашу жизнь✨

Приглашаем на 3-недельный безмолвный ретрит в г.Тируваннамалай, Южная Индия.
Три недели молчания для познания Себя Истинного ?‍♂️

Даты проведения: 29 января - 18 февраля, 2023 (21 день)

? О РЕТРТИТЕ

? \"На Земле нет другого места, как Аруначала, которое даст покой твоему уму. Это Гуру моего Гуру.\"
Пападжи

Священная гора Аруначала в Южной Индии с ее безмятежной красотой – лучшее место для погружения в себя. Глубочайшее безмолвие, в котором неизменно пребывал знаменитый мудрец Рамана Махарши, присутствует здесь и сейчас.

? \"Для меня ясно одно: Аруначала это мой дом. Источник счастья.\"
Мадукар

На ретрите в течение трех недель мы будем направлять внимание внутрь, на Истинное Я.

Ничто так не освежает, как ум, становящийся день ото дня все более пустым. А благодаря регулярным занятиям йогой на рассвете и вегетарианскому аюрведическому питанию все тело оживает и начинает дышать в полную силу. 

﻿Возникающие вопросы можно задать Мадукару во время сатсанга. 

﻿Когда мысли теряют свою силу и ваше внутреннее пространство открывается для красоты, Мастер ведет вас глубже в тишину, в откровение истины.

?‍♂️ ЧТО БУДЕТ НА РЕТРИТЕ

- Сатсанги с Мадукаром 2 раза в день ?
- Самоисследование (Атма-Вичара), медитация ?‍♂️
- Прадакшина – обход вокруг священной Аруначалы ?
- Прогулки к золотому пруду и посещение ашрама Шри Раманы Махарши ?
- Гуру Сева ?
- Бесплатные занятия йогой по утрам?‍♂️?‍♀️
- Киртаны и танцы ?
- 3-х разовое вегетарианское питание ?

?Участники соглашаются отключить цифровые устройства, а также на время ретрита принять строгий обет молчания.  ﻿Возникающие вопросы можно задать Мадукару во время сатсанга.

?Ретрит будет проходить в уединенном ашраме. Территорию ашрама можно покидать только в составе группы вместе с Мастером.


? ОТЗЫВЫ
участников прошлых ретритов в Тируваннамалае

\"От всего сердца благодарю Вас за то, что Ваша милость привела меня в это место. Красота и покой здесь вездесущи, невероятны, небесны, и «я-Гизела» не может поверить, что мне позволено оказаться здесь.\"
Гизела

\"Спасибо за Милость и возможность мне приехать в это Священное место, где разлита какая-то особая Благодать, которая завораживает и успокаивает. Здесь все наполнено безмятежностью, спокойствием и безмолвием.\"
Ольга, Москва

About:

The trek to Kalavantin Durg is one of the most dangerous and adrenaline-pumping adventures across India which is strictly not recommended for beginners, or those with vertigo or fear of heights. This trek first begins with an easy uphill climb to Prabalmachi, the base village of Kalavatin, followed by summiting the Kalavantin fortress. To reach the fortress, you will be ascending through steep and narrow rock-cut steps with no iron rails or any support on one side. The trail gets steeper and vertigo-inducing as you make your way up while enjoying the incredible views of the green jungle below. During rains, the trail gets slippery and you should be extremely careful while trekking, especially during the descent.

Batch 2: 9th - 11th July 2022
Price Rs 3149/- per person (Mumbai - Mumbai)
Location: Goa
Type: Trail
Grade: Medium

About:
Dudhsagar Waterfalls- springing from a lofty height of 600m is located on the Goa-Karnataka border. It lies at a distance of 60 km from Panaji and 10 km from Colem Railway Station. Dudhsagar Falls (literally Sea of Milk ) is a tiered waterfall located on the Mandovi River in the Indian state of Goa on Goa's border with Karnataka state. It is four-tiered.

Dudhsagar is one of the world's most exquisite falls. It lies high up in the Mandovi River's watershed and so is not particularly spectacular during the dry season. During the monsoon season, however, the falls are transformed into one of the most powerful falls in India. 

Dudhsagar Falls is listed as India's fifth tallest waterfall and is 227th in the world at 310 m. The water plummets hundreds of meters (over a thousand feet) in large volumes during the rainy monsoon season, forming one of the most spectacular natural phenomena in Goa. It is a major part of the Goa ecosystem. It is a four-tiered waterfall with a total height of 310 meters (1017 feet) and an average width of 30 meters (100 feet)

One has to get down at Kulem (Collem) railway station and walk towards the falls which are about 11 km away. It normally takes 2–3 hours to reach. The famous photograph of Trains passing through before the waterfalls can be seen in this route and also the complete stretch of the falls will be visible while you hike towards the waterfalls.

Have you checked out Konnagar, on the west Bank of Hooghly? With all the buzz of the Europeans not very far from here, Konnagar had been a place of many pioneering activities and residences of some well known personalities of Bengal. And so we have a heritage trail worth knowing and understanding. It is a pity that many are being slowly lost to oblivion. In this tour we will try and discover the heritages in this small town. We feel Konnagar has never been highlighted properly with all its rich history. It is always the towns of Serampore, Chinsurah, Chandannagore,  and Bandel that have grabbed all the attention.  Come and spend a day with us exploring Konnagar. You will surely be enlightened!

TRANSPORT :
Inside Konnagar, Auto/Toto will be used to take you through the places. 

FOOD PLAN:
1. Breakfast and tea at Konnagar from the road side eateries will be served
2. Lunch of noodles and chicken tossed in sauce (or fried) at a lovely place - 'Boi Thek' at Uttarpara, will be served at this last stop. 
3. Packaged drinking water

WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ENTRY INSIDE THE HERITAGES AND OTHER PLACES OF INTEREST. IF THEY ARE OPEN AND ALLOW VISITORS THEN ONLY WE CAN GAIN AN ENTRY. PLEASE CO-OPERATE WITH US IN MAKING THIS TRIP A MEMORABLE ONE.

We have lined up for an ecstatic Saturday evening at Hotel Royal Orchid Lawns for a special edition of Azure Ind as we bring down one of the finest LIVE acts Teho having releases on the top notch labels: CERCLE , HERZBLUT, LABO T and more. He is all set to take us for a melodic journey with his music. We also got the best homegrown acts lined up for you to kickoff the sublime vibes. We are all set to give you the best of experience by our massive production that leaves a memory in your heart. See you all there and yes, grab those tickets before its sold out.

About the artist:
Teho was born in 1990 in a small town near Montpellier, in the south of France. At the age of 11, a bass guitar in hand, he tries to play all the songs he likes. He discovered the world of electronic music when he was 15 but it was two years later that he decided to start producing music after seeing Daft Punk in concert. Also inspired by the musical universe of the legendary club Bar Live After, it naturally turns towards a melodic techno style influenced by artists such as James Holden, or even Stephan Bodzin.

Today, counting several millions plays on his tracks, and playing his music all over the world, Teho has found his place in the electronic music scene. With his own musical universe, both dreamy and melancholic, but also full of energy, Teho succeeded to combine different musical genres to create his own hybrid and melodic techno, almost electronica.

? Introduction: 

India is the birthplace of yoga. The first mention of yoga can be found in one of the ancient Sanskrit scriptures, Rig Veda which is considered  up to 10,000 years old. Some consider it timeless as are its teachings. 

All yogic aspirants and enthusiasts must go to India to touch the roots of this ancient practice and learn very many things about it that is impossible to learn and feel from a faraway western country. 

For this purpose and for the natural sceneries, hospitable people, and ancient cultures and traditions, I have organised another yoga retreat in India. 

We will spend 12 nights in Rishikesh, one of the oldest yogic towns in the world, at the foothills of the mighty Himalayas, by the sacred Ganges river and explore yoga, its many aspects and feel its teachings in the lives of local inhabitants. 

We will practice asana, pranayama, meditation in the banks of the river, surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. 

We will visit temples, ashrams, caves, waterfalls.

We will do a sunrise trek and meditate with the setting sun sitting by the river. 

We will learn basics of Ayurveda, receive an Ayurvedic consultation by a local physician, and receive a rejuvenating Ayurvedic massage. 

We will experience local customs such as Ganga Aarti, where the whole town is lit-up during the sunset and Lord Shiva and river Ganga is worshipped with devotional chanting and music. 

Since, our arrival is one-day prior to one of the biggest Indian festivals, Diwali, we will start off the retreat by experiencing the whole town ready to celebrate and we will celebrate with them.

? About Rishikesh: 

Within India, Rishikesh is considered the birthplace of yoga and calls itself, 'The World Capital of Yoga' and rightly so. The town is home to many yogis today and has been a home to some of the greatest yogis India has witnessed. The town is full of Ashrams established by yogis and now by more modern ashrams established by today's yogis. Wherever you look, you find a yoga centre. The place is a high vibrating field of sacred energy. 
Besides, Rishikesh is extremely picturesque. People are warm and hospitable, food is delicious, weather is pleasant. And besides yoga, one can do adventure activities such as river rafting and bungee jumping. There are many short and long hikes that start from Rishikesh and the town also serves as the entry town to explore higher Himalayan regions. 

?

? Why October: 

Not too hot, not too cold, the river turns turquoise and transparent. Sky is clearer. It is so serene and pristine that it is the best time to visit.

It is situated at an altitude of 6,207 ft and is the 3rd highest peak of Karnataka after Mullayyangiri and Baba Budangiri.

Kudremukh is a home for many flora and fauna. You can even spot deer and peacocks on the way amongst other wildlife while trekking!

This time the Summit is going to be held in Sonipat in association with the most Prestigious Rishihood University.
The Theme of I.N.S.P.I.R.E. 2022 is “THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX- REVIVAL, RESURRECTION   and RE- CREATION of Education post Epidemic.”
We all are aware that post 2020 the education and  the whole world came to a forced stand still. The fear of the unknown engulfed the human race and grossly impacted the physical and mental being of all. Lifestyle changed overnight and humans imperatively boarded the rescue flight of survival .Similarly education after a big jolt suddenly changed its form, and as a shapeshifter it broke all the barriers and galloped forward.
When all thought there was no way ahead, Human intelligence in tandem with Technology, Artificial intelligence and Virtual reality rose like a PHOENIX from the ashes and boarded its flight towards an emerging era of a new way of learning.
This is one flight that shouldn’t be missed because if it happens so those left behind will be under the radar of being extinct as many others who didn’t change with the only constant i.e . CHANGE.
 
The conference will have eminent Eduleaders, Eduspeakers and Eduspirers who will share their Thoughts to solidify the thought and also take this flight to new horizons and dimensions.
They will be bringing new perspectives on
1. Inclusion- Addressing the Unconscious bias in Education
2. The Trinity intelligence: Artificial, Augmented &amp; Human
3. Art based therapies- the professional touch and beyond the literal
4.The Future of Education- A paradigm shift
5. Edu Warriors- the Evolvers in the changing world
6. Homeschooling-The new normal and an alternative to the regular
7. The Impact of Social Media-  Building the Bridges of Communication for a better world.
8. SDGs 2030- journey towards  a happier healthier wholesome world
9.  Neuroscience -The brain Science transforming the learning
10. Global Citizenship- The potential of Civic Education, Cultural Diversity &amp; Care of Planet Earth
11.Global Competencies - The Shifting dynamics of Educational Planning
12. Metaverse &amp; Emerging Technologies- Preparing Educators for the impact
13. Creating Learning Communities - Connecting Families &amp; Societies across the globe
14. Differential Learning - Personalized &amp; Self-paved Learning
15. Literacies that Matter- Financial &amp; Entrepreneurship
16. The Focus Shift- Skills for Life-  Self-Awareness ,Social Awareness ,Global Awareness

Grade: Medium

About:
Dudhsagar Waterfalls- springing from a lofty height of 600m is located on the Goa-Karnataka border. It lies at a distance of 60 km from Panaji and 10 km from Colem Railway Station. Dudhsagar Falls (literally Sea of Milk ) is a tiered waterfall located on the Mandovi River in the Indian state of Goa on Goa's border with Karnataka state. It is four-tiered.

Dudhsagar is one of the world's most exquisite falls. It lies high up in the Mandovi River's watershed and so is not particularly spectacular during the dry season. During the monsoon season, however, the falls are transformed into one of the most powerful falls in India. 
Dudhsagar Falls is listed as India's fifth tallest waterfall and is 227th in the world at 310 m. The water plummets hundreds of meters (over a thousand feet) in large volumes during the rainy monsoon season, forming one of the most spectacular natural phenomena in Goa. It is a major part of the Goa ecosystem. It is a four-tiered waterfall with a total height of 310 meters (1017 feet) and an average width of 30 meters (100 feet)

One has to get down at Kulem (Collem) railway station and walk towards the falls which are about 11 km away. It normally takes 2–3 hours to reach. The famous photograph of Trains passing through before the waterfalls can be seen in this route and also the complete stretch of the falls will be visible while you hike towards the waterfalls.

With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.

Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new.

7:45am to 10am

Starting point : Metropolitan Building, the majestic building (picture of the building in our banner of this event) at the corner of SN Banerjee Road crossing with JN Road. 

Winston Churchill famously said, history is written by the victors. On the other hand, the American author Robert Fulghum said, \"I believe imagination is stronger than knowledge, that myth is more potent than history\". The city of Calcutta's history was first written by its founders, once Clive won it back from Siraj Ud-Daulah. Calcutta is a city that is the living history, of its people who made it what it was and what it is.

A very interesting walk to show you the many versions of this thriving old city.

This hospital was started 19 years back with 30 beds by young professionals with limited knowledge about hospital industry. They faced many hurdles in their course of growth. Medicall was born with the idea to share their expertise with the fellow medical fraternity.

Early in his career, he identified that nursing homes, small hospitals and clinics in tier 2 and 3 cities faced a distinct disadvantage in the market while procuring hospital equipment or service. They neither had the choice nor the price advantage enjoyed by the biggies.

While talking about the motivation behind starting this expo, Dr Manivannan S says, \"Small and medium sized hospital owners from tier II and III cities cannot afford to have qualified purchase managers. Equipment companies also do not have adequate sale force to meet all these hospital owners. Since I have undergone the difficulty for my hospital, I thought Medicall will bring in all equipment manufacturers under one roof.\"

Medicall serves as a marketing platform wherein the equipment companies showcase their products and services to Hospital owners and decision makers.

Since MEDICALL is being organized by people who have been in Healthcare field for many years, the content and the quality of the visitors are expected to be better than any other previously held event.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events7/banners/c80d20b32b8af27a91761ac349307a793a304ccf53c7962d07c2b79ccd6dc4f2-rimg-w960-h503-gmir.jpg?v=1655974796",68.900,"nonprofit,business,exhibitions,workshops"

*Overview*
===========
Valley of flowers National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, situated at an altitude of 3352 to 3658 meters above sea level, located in Uttarakhand State known for its most captivating meadows and endemic species of Alpine flowers. The park, open from June to September, offers a fantastic panoramic view with a vibrant green background, landscapes, skylines and cascading waterfalls. The clouds, the high-altitude mountains and abundant waterfalls make this place a perfect go. As the clouds start coming down, you can barely see the enormous glacier to the right of and below. While you could spot a lot of familiar flowers, you will also witness some never before seen varieties of alpine flowers. For most of the year, the valley lies coated under layers of snow with beautiful and rare flowers everywhere. The beauty of the \"Valley of Flowers National Park\" and \"Shri Hemkund Sahib\" cannot be expressed in words and hence we recommend this at least once in a lifetime experience.

Rajasthan, czyli kraina maharadżów słynie z licznych fortów, ale także z rękodzieła i folkloru. 

Podczas tej wycieczki zwiedzimy stolicę Indii - Delhi oraz majestatyczny Taj Mahal. Następnie rozpoczniemy trasę wgłąb Pustyni Thar, poprzez Jaipur, Pushkar i Jodhpur do Jaisalmeru. Po Festiwalu wrócimy przez Bikaner i Mandawę. Jeśli nazwy te nie mówią wiele, zaufaj nam. Napisz do nas, otrzymasz szczegółowy program i wytyczne, jak się przygotować.

Wyjazd ten jest organizowany dla koneserów sztuki, dlatego planowany jest dodatkowo warsztat tańca cyganek Kalbelia, dla zainteresowanych. Oprócz Festiwalu Pustynnego nie odpuścimy żadnej okazji, by zobaczyć radżasthański folklor. Będzie sporo czasu na buszowanie po bazarach, bo najlepsze zakupy robi się tutaj. Jeśli nie wiesz wiele o sztuce Indii, nie obawiaj się dołączyć do nas dla świetnej zabawy.

Unsere Frauen-Pilgerreise zur Quelle von Ganga und Yamuna im Himalaya. \"Devi Yatra\" bedeutet \"Göttinnen Pilgerreise\": Pilgere im Kreis der Frauen zu bedeutsamen Tempeln der göttlichen Mutter im Himalaya!

Diese Frauen-Pilgerreise führt zu den Quellen der beiden heiligen Flüsse Ganga und Yamuna, beide werden dort als Göttinnen verehrt. Auf der Route der Devi Yatra stehen noch mehrere weitere Tempel für Aspekte der göttlichen Mutter. So kannst Du Dich bei dieser Reise in der Natur mit Deiner Weiblichkeit befassen und im Frauenkreis neue Kraft schöpfen.

Ganga und Yamuna: Die göttliche Mutter im Himalaya

Die beiden Flüsse haben eine besondere mystische Kraft, der man sich kaum entziehen kann. Sie sind Manifestationen der Göttinnen Yami und Ganga, die konkret erfahrbar sind. Eine Meditation am Fluss, oder sogar ein rituelles Bad kann eine tiefschürfende Erfahrung auf dem spirituellen Weg sein.

    Der Ganges (in Indien \"Ganga Ma\") gilt allen Hindus als heilig, ein Mal im Leben die Quelle besuchen ist der Traum vieler Inder. 10% der Menschheit lebt im Einzugsbereich des heiligen Flusses Ganga, oben im Himalaya ist es jedoch eher dünn besiedelt. Am Quellort Gangotri gibt es eine Gletscherwanderung ins Hochgebirge zum \"Gaumukh\", einem besonderen und uralten Ort der Askese.
   
    Die Yamuna ist auch einer der sieben heiligen Flüsse Indiens und der wichtigste Nebenfluss der Ganga. Die beiden Quellorte liegen bloß ca. 35km Luftlinie auseinander, mit dem Auto sind es bereits 213km, jedoch fließt die Yamuna erst nach 1376km in Allahabad/Prayagraj in die Ganga.

About:

Located in the same mountain range as Matheran, Peb fort is an enjoyable trek for a day’s outing.

The fort derives its name from the Goddess 'Pebi'; Peb is also called 'Vikatgad' for its supposed shape of the Elephant Headed God, 'Ganesh'. The trek to the top involves surmounting a small rock patch and a ladder.

The fort is famous for its caves which are maintained by disciples of Swami Samartha and the meditation chambers carved out from the rock inside the mountain. To get inside the meditation chamber, one has to crawl through a narrow passage in the rock and then climb down into the meditation chamber. The chamber is very well maintained with tiles on the floor for ppl to sit and meditate.

The fort also has a temple dedicated to Swami Samartha on the top and has the footwear or 'Padukas' worn by the great saint kept on the top. The view of the entire Neral and Karjat region from the top is worth the climb. Another attraction of the trek is the only standing Bastion or Buruj facing the Panorama point of Matheran, the view from here is just too beautiful to describe.

About Decathlon

Decathlon is a global brand with global goals. Sustainability and awareness is a global agenda at the moment and protecting the environment is the responsibility of every individual. Which is why at decathlon have decided to engage community in an eco-friendly manner hoping to build on the work we are already doing in the background (MIA Recycled materials etc ). 

As a local initiative we want all our users not just the fitness enthusiasts but also the average joe to come and be a part of our run to save the planet. we will be showcasing sustainable living programs during the event and will also be highlighting the need for a drastic change in all our daily activities. 

Running is one of the best ways to improve your lifestyle and also cut back on the carbon footprint. running/jogging/walking are safe and healthy alternatives to combustion-oriented travel and if every individual tries to incorporate them into their regular routine we will be making a huge impact when it comes to saving the environment. Not to mention the overall health benefits of running outdoors cannot be underestimated. 

Green psychology has a direct influence on our happiness running releases endorphins that trigger a happy response within and countless other physiological benefits that can only be achieved through cardio activity. 

We would like to share our belief with every citizen of Amdavad Lets make Running accessible to the many.

Children naturally possess inquiring minds and we will help channel their inquiries to deeper insights and greater understanding. Kalinga Centre for Rainforest Ecology (KCRE), a biodiversity field station will be the base and catalyst in enabling children to observe, question and look at wilderness from a new perspective. 
To start with we will expose them to the Earth's oldest living ecosystems and its dynamics - the Western Ghats. Understanding these rainforests will offer a rare glimpse into the evolutionary and ecological potential of this magnificent landscape. Our experts will draw a scientific perspective to provide kids with a strong understanding of what makes these rainforests so significant. 
The learning process will entail teamwork, problem-solving capabilities, roughing it out in the field, data collection, time management, information synthesis, and using appropriate tools all under the guidance and mentoring by experts.

Inner Technology National Residential Conference on \"Introspect - Innovate - Integrate\"

02 - 06 September 2022
(Friday - Tuesday)

Venue: 
Brahma Kumaris, Auditorium
Manmohinivan Complex,
Danvav, Abu Road, Rajasthan
Pincode - 307510

Theme: 
An enlightened 3-day National IT Conference will be organised for IT professionals, through which everyone will be able to find solutions for everyday challenges by learning Inner Technology.

The purpose of this event is to learn the \"Art of Balanced Life\" for a more productive and positive lifestyle. Join us to experience the connection between Introspect, Innovate, and Integrate.

▪️ Introspect - In times of chaos, we always tend to find solutions outside. Rather, Inner Technology teaches us to introspect within and examine what it is that we need to change. Self-checking teaches us that the solution can be found within.

▪️ Innovate - Innovation does not originate from technology alone; it lies within all of us. It’s about bringing newness to our thoughts, words, and actions, thereby increasing productivity and finding a new personality of our own, which enables us to learn from the past and move on with greater positivity and stability.

▪️ Integrate - Integrate means fitting in. Through Inner Journey, we will be able to fit into any situation that makes life easy and comfortable.

Lashlifting ist neben der Wimpernverlängerung auch eine der beliebtesten Beautytrends. Für diese Schulung gibt es keine Voraussetzungen und ganz egal ob du aus der Beauty Branche kommst oder du einfach als Quereinsteiger oder Anfänger in der Beauty Welt Fuß fassen möchtest, diese Schulung ist für dich super geeignet.

Auf dem deutschen Markt gibt es immer mehr Beauty Bars, die Lash &amp; Brow Lifting anbieten, und alleine durch diese zwei Behandlungen umsatzstark profitieren. Auch als Zusatzleistung z.B beim Friseur, im Nagelstudio, in Sonnenstudios oder andernorts sind diese zwei Trendbehandlungen ein profitables Zusatzgeschäft. Wir zeigen dir, wie du die Naturwimpern deiner Kundinnen dunkler, länger und voller aussehen lassen kannst – ganz ohne Wimpernverlängerung und ohne Wimpernzange. Eine Behandlung in deinem Studio dauert ca. eine Stunde und ist eine gute Alternative zur Wimpernverlängerung. Sie eignet sich zudem hervorragend für all diejenigen, die aufgrund einer Allergie keine Wimpernverlängerung tragen können. Dies ist somit ein guter Nebenverdienst, ohne großen Aufwand. Nach einem ausführlichen theoretischen Teil arbeitest du an einem Modell um das Erlernte optimal zu vertiefen.

An dieser Trendbehandlung kommst du zurzeit nicht vorbei ￼ Das Brow Lifting ist der absolute Renner. Folgende Benefits bringt es mit sich:

 Es verleiht den Augenbrauen mehr Fülle

Optisch mehr Volumen

Haltbarkeit bis zu 8 Wochen

Brows on Fleek – Und das den ganzen Tag

Ein absolutes Muss für all diejenigen, die neue Kunden gewinnen möchten. Nicht nur der Effekt für die Kundin ist sehenswert, auch dein Nutzen als Stylist/in ist nicht zu unterschätzen. Eine Behandlungsdauer von etwa einer halben Stunde macht die Anwendung super profitabel. Du hast die Möglichkeit an diesem Tag auch die Kenntnisse des Brow Liftings zu erwerben. Der Aufpreis für diese Schulung liegt bei 100 Euro.

Solltest Du dich dafür entscheiden, dann teile uns das einfach per E-Mail mit.

Bei einer Zusendung von guten Bildern 3 verschiedener Modelle, erhälst Du dein Zertifikat.

Wszystko pod opieką polskiej pilotki mówiącej w hindi, tancerki oraz certyfikowanej nauczycielki jogi.

Kerala jest wymarzonym miejscem na odpoczynek, gdy w Polsce temperatury spadają i dzień staje się krótki. Słońce, błękitne niebo, intensywna zieleń bujnej egzotycznej roślinności, gaje palm kokosowych, pola ryżowe, szmaragdowe rozlewiska. Piaszczyste plaże przyciągają wielbicieli słońca i ciepłego morza. W głębi lądu plantacje herbaty i przypraw kuszą zapachami. Spokojny i jeden z bogatszych stanów w Indiach charakteryzuje się gościnnością i tolerancją. Organizowane festiwale zadziwiają przepychem i rozmachem. Kerala to też pyszna kuchnia, chyba jedna z najsmaczniejszych w Indiach.

Varkala – tu się zatrzymamy – jest niewielkim nadmorskim miasteczkiem, znanym z 15-metrowego czerwonego klifu nad szeroką piaszczystą plażą. To ciche, spokojne miejsce, z senną atmosferą w ciągu dnia, rozbudzające się przed spektaklem zachodzącego słońca.

ATRAKCJE w VARKALI
Oprócz codziennych lekcji jogi i tańca, spacerowania po plaży i leniuchowania w hamaku pod palmą, zapraszamy na opowieści o  indyjskiej „wiedzy o  życiu” czyli ajurwedzie. Dodatkowo można skorzystać z  zabiegów ajurwedyjskich, pójść na spektakl Kathakali albo na kurs gotowania po keralsku.

 REJS PO KANAŁACH – WENECJI WSCHODU. Na słynnych rozlewiskach tzw. backwaters, zobaczymy  bujną roślinność i  życie ludzi mieszkających wzdłuż  kanałów.
Pojedziemy na plantację herbaty i przypraw.


PLAN POBYTU:

    • Codzienne zajęcia jogi i medytacji
      Joga według  METODA B.K.S. IYENGARA, charakteryzuje się precyzją i dokładnością, kładzie nacisk na odpowiednie ustawienie ciała w asanach. Jest to doskonale narzędzie do poznawania ciała i jego rozumienia. Pomaga w rozwijaniu  uważności i obserwacji nas samych, naszych emocji. Buduje  siłę i elastyczności.
    • Codzienne zajęcia tańca indyjskiego. W zależności od zainteresowania uczestników taniec bollywood, taniec klasyczny, nauka gestów, choreografii. Dla większej gracji ruchów i dla dobrej zabawy.
      Zajęcia są dla wszystkich: praktykujących i tych, co jeszcze nie zaczęli. Niezależnie od poziomu zaawansowania, mamy nadzieję, że wszyscy po powrocie do domu będziemy cieszyć się większą elastycznością, lekkością i radością. Poczujemy mocny zastrzyk energii i dobre samopoczucie.

Sandakphu Phalut: one of the few treks on earth where you can see four 8,000 m peaks. When you reach 3,636 m on Sandakphu, on your left is the Everest cluster. On your right, is the world’s 3rd highest peak, Kanchenjunga, standing with its family of peaks. This family of peaks is famously called The Sleeping Buddha.

This is a trekker’s paradise. Away from the routine city, this trek offers a chance to embrace the simple, peaceful, and joyous life of the remote hills. Untouched by human machinery, people revel in the quietude of these high peaks; unattainable and undisturbed. Enjoy the panoramic views Sandakphu provides of the very best that nature has to offer, including towering mountains, colorful orchids, and the mystical temperate forests.

??? ????????? is this? ? https://youtu.be/soSCLvcfn74 https://youtu.be/VF8zYb4qM_U

Extra 2 nights in Darjeeling - well-known for its tea industry, views of the world's 3rd-highest mountain, and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

We will plan our Delhi to Bagdogra airport [IXB] flights in such a way so as to reach Bagdogra before 12pm. It takes 4-5
hours drive from Airport to base camp . There is no trekking today.

Altitude: 6,400 ft (1,951 m) to 9,450 ft (2,880 m) Time taken: 6-7 hours, 11 km . The first hour is through the jungle and then it opens up as we approach the first check post.

Altitude: 9,450 ft (2,880 m) to 10,400 ft (3,170 m) Time taken: 6-7 hours, 13 km. Today we will walk through meadows without seeing a single person for hours. Thanks to the fact that Sandhakphu is not as easy as Manali to reach.

Altitude: 10,400 ft (3,170 m) to 11,950 ft (3,642 m) Time taken: 3 hours, 6 km. Today you will reach the highest point of your trek. My past trekkers say this evening was the most memorable; especially the sunset.

Even though today you will be walking the longest, you won’t feel as such as we will be walking through a variety of different landscapes: Jungles, meadows, riversides. And if you are super lucky, you might even see a Red panda too.

Altitude: 7,546 ft (2,300 m) to 6,234 ft (1,900 m) Time taken: 4-5 hours, 15 km Difficulty: Easy, mostly level walks interspersed with a few ascents and descents.

Today we wake up late and step out to the Darjeeling Zoo to see the elusive and amazing leopards of all time. We will easily spend 2 hours without knowing where the time passed in this zoo.
After which, we will make a quick stop at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute and see the history of mountaineering. Did you know Darjeeling has a small village with over 1000 Everesters ? Most of them go to Everest region for work in the season.

Jyotiba, the holy shrine of Lord Kedarnath up in the hills near the bustling city with its true Maratha flavour. It is not for nothing that Jyotiba is called the ‘The King of the Deccan’. Throughout the year the deity draws devotees in huge numbers.

The route was scenic with greenery all around, wide and clean roads. The runners will start from the area of temple and make their way through the scenic curvy route.

While Sundays are special for visiting this temple, this would be first kind of sports event happening at this place on 21st August 2022. With smear ‘gulal’ (pink coloured sacred powder) on everyone’s foreheads and everywhere else turning the whole mountain into a beautiful pink.

We believe this event will go a long way in further promoting running in this place and encourage a fit and healthy lifestyle.

আমাদের এই ইভেন্টে অংশ গ্রহন করতে হলে অবশ্যই যে কথাগুলো আপনার মনে রাখতে হবেঃ
*** এই ট্রিপটি কোন ট্রেকিং ট্রিপ না হলেও এই ট্রিপটি একটু এক্সপ্লোর টাইপের ফুল রোড জার্নি টাইপ ট্রিপ। এই ট্রিপে টানা ২-৩ ও জার্নির উপর একাধিক বার থাকা লাগবে। আপনার জার্নি করতে কোন সমস্যা থাকলে অবশ্যি এই ট্রিপ আপনার জন্য নয়। 
*** এই ট্রিপটি যেহেতু বেশির ভাগ সময় জার্নির উপর থাকা লাগবে তাই অনেক সময় খাবারের কোন ঠিক ঠিকানা থাকবে না । উপস্থিত সময়ে ধারের কাছে যা কিছুই পাওয়া যাবে সেগুলো দিয়েই উদরপূর্তি করা হবে তাই আপনার খাওয়া দাওয়া নিয়ে কোন সমস্যা থাকলে অবশ্যই এই ট্রিপ আপনার জন্য নয়। 
*** এই ট্রিপটির যদিও সব বাস এবং ট্রেনের টিকিট আগের থেকেই কনফার্ম করা থাকবে কিছু কিছু ক্ষেত্রে বেশ কিছু কাজ ইন্সটান্ট করা হবে সময় এবং পরিবেশ বুঝে তাই এই সংক্রান্ত কারো আপত্তি থাকা যাবে না । 
*** আপনি যদি ঘুরতে গিয়ে শুধু খুত খুজতে থাকেন মানে কমপ্লীন টাইপের হোন তাহলে আগে থেকেই আপনি এই ইভেন্ট এড়িয়ে চলুন। 
*** এই ট্রিপে বেশ কিছু সিদ্ধান্ত ইন্সটান্ট নেয়া হবে সময় এবং পরিস্থিতি বুঝে। এই ক্ষেত্রে গ্রুপ হোস্ট সকলের সাথে আলোচনা সাপেক্ষে যেই সিদ্ধান্ত নিবেন সেটাই মেনে নিতে হবে এতে কোন ওজর আপত্তি চলবে  না।  

*** প্রাকৃতিক যে কোন জটিলতায় সবাই হেল্পফুল থাকতে হবে সে ক্ষেত্রে ইভেন্ট ফি এর বাহিরেও যদি এক্সট্রা কোন খরচ হয় সেটা সবাই সমানভাবে দিতে হবে।

❑❑❑প্ল্যানে যে কোন ধরনের চেঞ্জ হতে পারে। প্ল্যানে পরিস্থিতির উপর বিবেচনা করেই চেঞ্জ করা হবে। এতে এডমিনদের সিদ্ধান্তই চুড়ান্ত সিদ্ধান্ত। এতে কোন ওজর আপত্তি চলবে না।

It’s one of those special, almost sacred journeys that bikers dream of since the day they discover their passion for riding. And we pride ourselves on having made this dream come true for hundreds of riders since our first Ladakh ride in 2013.

This year is extra special. Especially because we’ve been forced to stay away from leisure travel due to the pandemic, we know how desperately we want to feel the crisp, cold Ladakhi air against our sunburnt cheeks, ride on occasionally non-existent roads with the mighty Himalayas watching over us. Just you, your machine, and the vast expanse of an unseen world. Exposed to the elements, immersed in the region’s rusticity. It doesn’t get better than this, we promise!

So join us for this epic adventure and make memories you will cherish for the rest of your life. The journey isn’t for the fainthearted, but that’s the charm. It’s difficult, but it’s worth every ounce of discomfort you endure. And the Musafirs will be right by your side, leveraging our longstanding expertise with this treacherous terrain to guide you, cheer you, and protect you. Come, let’s ride together – because that’s the only way we know. With us, you’ll always have someone to watch your back and bring you home. Experience the difference that our 11-years motorcycling legacy and experience bring to the table.

The only downside is that we always sell out pretty quickly once we announce our Ladakh rides. We keep our groups small to encourage bonding and ensure maximum safety of all our riders, so don’t wait on this one. It’s a now or never kind of ride so register today and experience the unparalleled thrill of riding on top of the world.

The Ride Plan – Key Highlights:
28 June is when we’ll meet you at Jammu with your bike! From here, we do a short ride to the accommodation. Here we discuss the plan for the next 12 days and prep you up for the challenges and memories that will make you smile even in your afterlife.

On this ride you’ll experience:

Sonamarg.  Known as the Meadow of Gold, Sonmarg is the gateway to Ladakh and is known for its verdant and picturesque valleys and snow-clad peaks.
Chenani Tunnel. The longest road tunnel in India. Riding through this fairly new tunnel, that’s more than NINE kilometers long is an experience in itself. And what awaits a few kilometers on the other side is the famous rajma chawal – desi ghee with anaardaana chutney at Peerah (google it!)
Zozi La. The first high-mountain pass you’ll be riding through on this route … and if lucky, you may experience snow!
Kargil War Memorial. This war is memorial situated at Dras at the foothills of Tololing Hills. We bet you’ll not come out of this place without tears in your eyes.
Leh.
Diskit-Nubra. You’ll ride through the Khardung La to reach here – it’s probably the only place in India where your camera will capture — Snow-capped peaks, a huge sand desert, a river, and double-humped camels in the same shot. Mesmerizing — to say the least.
Siachen Base Camp.  At 12K feet visit the OP BABA SHRINE located at the SBC.
Merak. No roads and an amazing view of the Pangong Tso.
Hanle. Hanle, in the Changthang valley, has a scenic landscape that is unique even to Ladakh — and it boasts of one of the world’s highest observatories. Very close to the Indo-China line of actual control. ILP-dependent.
Tso Kar. Another less frequented high-altitude lake — is known for various rare species sightings.
Baralacha La and the ATAL Tunnel. Few places simply need no introduction.
Officially, the ride ends once we touch Chandigarh on the 10th of July.

Peace of Mind
In tow with our convoy, throughout the ride, we will have a support vehicle – not an Innova or a Scorpio but a proper bolero camper that can carry your whole bike and you in case of a breakdown or any other uneventful situation. Thus, you can focus only on experiencing the terrain and enjoy the adrenaline rush.

Aligning the Stars
We understand that 2 weeks of leaves is a problem in your corporate office and you’ll need permission from your boss, spouse, parents, kids, etc … keeping this in mind, we’ve designed a unique 13-day ride so “Leaves not approved” does not stop you from experiencing this epic adventure. The ride begins on a Tuesday and ends on a Sunday.

Fine Print:
The Himalayan terrain is unpredictable – landslides, roadblocks, snow, cloud bursts etc., may result in last-minute change of route and staying at unplanned locations.

Even in disruption, you are to stick together and we will have your back.

However, the expenses of unfactored distance covered by the support vehicle and of unplanned lodging boarding due to terrain disruptions will be split among all the participants.

Commercial “tour operators” will not say this until the disruption has occurred and levy an untransparent additional cost… but we aren’t one of those commercial tour operators. We are the Musafirs Motorcycle Club. Experience the difference!

The Bold Print
We are an inclusive club – your age, gender, caste, religion, profession, sexual orientation, etc., does not matter. What matters the most is the head and heart that drives the machine and the soul! We strictly follow the no-drug and no-litter policy – if you can’t adhere, please F.O. That’s exactly how serious we are when it comes to these. 

The Ride Plan
Jammu – Sonamarg – Leh – Nubra – Saichen Base Camp – Turtuk – Pangong Tso – Hanle – Tso Kar – JIspa – Naggar – Chandigarh.

The valley is inaccessible during winters, the beauty unadulterated; the thrill of riding this part of the Himalayas is unparalleled.

Every day of the ride will be a new experience – continuous hairpin bends and amazing roads on a few days; and complete off-roading with riding under waterfalls, up a river, and passing through the World’s Most Treacherous Roads on others. The ride promises to deliver an experience incomparable to any other.

Come, let’s ride together – because that’s the only way we know. With us, you’ll always have someone to watch your back and bring you home. Experience the difference that our 11-years motorcycling legacy and experience bring to the table.

The Ride Plan – Key Highlights:
18 June is when we’ll meet you at Chandigarh with your bike! From here, we do a short ride to stay like royalty at a heritage fort converted into a hotel. Here we discuss the plan for the next nine days and prep you up for the challenges and memories that will make you smile even in your afterlife.

On this ride you’ll experience:

&gt;The green pastures of Chitkul – the last Indian village along the border.
&gt;A 1000+-year-old monastery at Tabo – the oldest, continuously operating monastery
&gt;The view from the highest altitude village in Asia – Komic and be able to send a postcard to your loved ones from the world’s highest post office at Hikkim
&gt;Seek blessings at GueStupa – famous for the mummy of a Buddhist monk that’s more than 500 years old
&gt;Off-roading to ChandraTaal. “Taal” means a lake and as the name suggests this one is the shape of a crescent. It’s one of the few high-altitude lakes in India and the inaccessibility has preserved it’s beauty.

Officially, the ride ends once we touch Chandigarh on the 26th of June. You can ship your bikes out the same night via Gati/Safe Express and fly out or you could choose to extend the trip and do the Leh circuit with us. 

Details of our Leh Ride plan coming up on the website soon.

Thus, you can focus only on experiencing the terrain and enjoy the adrenaline rush.

Aligning the Stars :

We understand that you’ll need permission from your boss, spouse, parents, kids, etc … keeping this in mind, we’ve planned it such that you’ll only be missed for ONE WEEK. The ride begins on a Saturday and ends on a Sunday – so you’ll need just a week of chutti from office and house chores ? .

And if you don’t have a bike but still want to experience it with the Musafirs, we could help you with rental bike options, connect with us if you wish to rent a bike.

A szigeten több vendégház közül választhatunk. Általában a szálláshoz reggeli jár, a többi étkezést saját magunknak megoldjuk az éttermek egyikében. A szigeten strandolhatunk, vagy akár bérelhetünk katamarán vitorlást, kenut, vagy jetskit.
A búvárhajó napi 3 merülésre fut ki, ebből 2 délelött és egy délután történik.
Ide bármilyen kombinációban lehet a csatlakozni.

A szállások egy éjszakára vetített költsége 65-90 USD között mozog szobánként (reggelivel), ehhez még hozzájön az étkezés, ami nagyjából 30 USD/nap/fő. A gyorshajó oda-vissza költsége 100 USD.

Spantik was first climbed in 1955 by Karl Kramer’s German expedition. The most commonly climbed line follows the southeast ridge, which was attempted by the Bullock Workman party in 1906. The ridge rises 2700 meters over a lateral distance of 7.6 km, at angles which are mostly less than 30 degrees, with a few sections up to 40 degrees. It contains varied terrain, from rocky outcrops to snow and ice and scree.
The mountain is very popular with organized commercial expeditions, due to its relative ease of ascent and scarcity of objective dangers. The short 3day approach trek across straightforward terrain also provides for easy access and gradual acclimatization. This peak was scaled by the Aus-Pak expedition in July 2011 led by a team of mountaineers from Army High Altitude School Rattu. Lt Col Abdul Aziz was supervising the team of Climbers. The peak can be approached from Nagar Valley as well as from the Baltistan side. The First expedition was held in 1988, the team was composed of six Pakistan Army Personnel with German Team, the first Pakistani who reached the summit was Captain (now Brigadier) Muhammad Moiz Uddin Uppal, another expedition named the China-Pakistan Friendship Expedition scaled Spantik Peak.
Expedition leader Lt Col (retired) Dr. Abdul Jabbar Bhatti in a call from the summit said that the expedition members took turns to reach the summit between 1:45pm and 2:15pm on Sunday, July 15. Earlier, the summit team, which had started from Camp II (5, 600 meters) on July 14, set up Camp III (6,000 meters) the same day and pushed for the summit the following day. C III was established 300 meters lower than planned, which, combined with worst weather conditions and lack of visibility during the return from the summit, resulted in missing the route and forced the whole team to spend the night outside the camp, at the time when members were already exhausted. Digging out snow caves was the only option for protection from the extreme environment.

Experience a truly stunning 11 day trek through the Ladakh mountain range which is full of rich cultural heritage to summit Kang Yatse 2 at 6250m.

Breese Adventures are offering a 11 day trek in the Ladakh region of the Indian Himalaya.

We will trek though the high mountain desert in northern India which is known for its stunning landscape, clear blue skies, ancient monasteries and its rich cultural heritage.

On this trek we pass through villages with irrigated fields against against a backdrop of stark, colourful rocky landscape with monasteries clinging high up in the cliffs. We will start our trip by way of the exciting flight into Leh which is at 3500m height, and then spend a couple of days taking it easy to aid acclimatisation, exploring some of the monasteries around the area.

After this initial acclimatisation period, we trek through the beautiful Markha valley visiting several settlements and monasteries before our summit attempt on Kang Yatse 2 at 6250m.

Our itinerary can be flexible and gives us the best chance of acclimatisation and lets us immerse ourselves in the history and the culture of this amazing region and we allow an extra day for our summit attempt.

We use only the best in country team and a Breese Adventures leader will also be on the trip.

ಹಿಂದೆ ಚಿಕ್ಕದೊಂದು ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಿದ್ದು, ಕ್ರಮೇಣ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಹೊಂದಿ, ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಪ್ರಾಮುಖ್ಯತೆ ಗಳಿಸಿ, ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವೆಂಬ ದೊಡ್ಡ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಾಗಿ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯಾಗಿದೆ ಎಂದು ತಿಳಿದುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. 1799 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಧಿಕಾರಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರು ಈ ದೇವಿ ಅರಾಧಕರಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಶ್ರಧ್ದಾ ಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಪಡಿಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ದೊಡ್ಡದಾದ ದೇವಾಲಯವನ್ನಾಗಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಹಾಗೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಮಹತ್ವ ತಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಬೆಟ್ಟ ಚಾರಿತ್ರಿಕ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ, ವಿಜಯನಗರ ಹಾಗೂ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರ ಕೊಡುಗೆಯಿದೆ. 12ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ ದೊರೆ ವಿಷ್ಣುವರ್ಧನ ಹಾಗೂ 17ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ವಿಜಯನಗರದ ಅರಸರ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯನ್ನು ಗುರುತಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಕ್ರಿ.ಶ. 1573 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರು ದೇವಿಯನ್ನು ಪೂಜಿಸಲು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾಗ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಸಿಡಿಲು ಬಡಿದು ಅವರ ತಲೆಯ ಕೂದಲೆಲ್ಲಾ ಉದುರಿ ಹೋದವೆಂದು ಇತಿಹಾಸ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ.
ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ ಚೌಕಾಕೃತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣವಾಗಿದೆ. ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಟ್ಟಲಾಗಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ, ಹೆಬ್ಬಾಗಿಲು, ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರ, ನವರಂಗ, ಅಂತರಾಳ, ಗರ್ಭಗೃಹ, ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಕಾರಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಸುಂದರವಾದ `ಗೋಪುರ` ಮತ್ತು ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ 'ವಿಮಾನ' ಶಿಖರಗಳಿವೆ. ಏಳು ಅಂತಸ್ತುಗಳ ಗೋಪುರ 19ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದು ಪಿರಮಿಡ್ ಆಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದೆ. ಶಿಖರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಏಳು ಚಿನ್ನದ ಲೇಪಿತ ಕಲಶಗಳಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಹಿಷಮರ್ಧಿನಿಯಾದ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ವಿರಾಜಮಾನವಾಗಿದೆ. ಎಂಟು ಭುಜಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸೀನಳಾಗಿದ್ದಾಳೆ. ಈ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಪುರಾತನವಾದದ್ದು. ಈ ಶಿಲಾಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಮಾರ್ಖಂಡೇಯ ಋಷಿಗಳು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿದರೆಂದು ಸ್ಥಳ ಪುರಾಣ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ. 1827 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜಒಡೆಯರು ಸಾವಿರ ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೂ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಜೀರ್ಣೋಧ್ದಾರ ಮಾಡಿ ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಈ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಗೋಪುರವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಸಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹವಾಹನ' ಒಂದನ್ನು ಮರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸಿ ಕೊಡುಗೆ ನೀಡಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹ ವಾಹನ' ವನ್ನು ರಥೋತ್ಸವ ಸಂಧರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಸಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವಿಯ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನಿಟ್ಟು ರಥವನ್ನು ಎಳೆಯಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ಗಣಪತಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವನ್ನು ನೋಡಬಹುದು. ದ್ವಾರದ ಬೃಹತ್ ಮರದ ಬಾಗಿಲನ್ನು ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ತಗಡಿನಿಂದ ಹೊದಿಸಲಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ಬಾಗಿಲಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಹಲವು ಸ್ವರೂಪಗಳನ್ನು ತೋರಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಕೆಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಂದ್ರಾದಿ ಅಷ್ಠದಿಕ್ಪಾಲಕರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ.
ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದಿಂದ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋದರೆ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಸಣ್ಣ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ. ವಿಘ್ನರಾಜನಿಗೆ ನಮಿಸಿ ಕೆಲವು ಕಲ್ಲಿನ ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಹತ್ತಿಹೋದರೆ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಬಲಿಪೀಠ ಮತ್ತು ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭ ಕಂಡುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಬಲಿಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇವೆರಡರ ಮುಂಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಅಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ನಂದಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದೆ. ಮಾತೆ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯನ್ನು ಅದು ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸುತ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿದೆ. ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭಕ್ಕೆ ಈಶಾನ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಗೋಡೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಆಂಜನೇಯನ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದ್ದು ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ನಿತ್ಯ ಪೂಜೆ ಜರುಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಂದಿನಿ ಮತ್ತು ಕಮಲಿನಿ ಎಂಬ ದ್ವಾರಪಾಲಿಕೆಯರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳು ದ್ವಾರದ ಎಡ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಮುಂಚೆ ಇರುವ ಅತರಾಳದ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುದ್ದಾದ ಗಣಪಡತಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ. ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯ ಪಂಚಲೋಹದ ಸುಂದರ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯಿದೆ. ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಕ್ತನ ದಿರಿಸು ತೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರ ಆರು ಅಡಿ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸುಂದರ ಭಕ್ತ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಕಾಣಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರು ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂವರು ಪತ್ನಿಯರೊಂದಿಗೆ ದೇವಿಗೆ ಕೈಮುಗಿದು ನಿಂತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರ ಎಡಭಾಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂತಿರುವವರೆಂದರೆ ರಮಾವಿಲಾಸ, ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿವಿಲಾಸ ಮತ್ತು ಕೃಷ್ಣವಿಲಾಸ ಮಹಾರಾಣಿಯರು. ಇವರುಗಳ ಶಿಲಾ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳ ಪಾದದ ಬಳಿಯ ಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ಇವರುಗಳ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನು ಕೆತ್ತಲಾಗಿದೆ.
ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಅರ್ಚಕರು ತಾಯಿ ಸ್ವರೂಪದ ಶಿಲಾ ಪ್ರತಿಮೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿ ದಿನ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಿ ಪೂಜೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಯದುಕುಲದ ದೇವತೆಯಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆದು ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಗೆ ಮೈಸೂರಿನ ಮಹಾರಾಜರುಗಳು ಹಲವಾರು ಬೆಲೆಬಾಳುವ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಪರೂಪವಾದ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಶ್ರಧ್ಧಾಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಒಪ್ಪಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈ ಶಕ್ತಿ ದೇವತೆಗೆ ಮಾನವ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಬಲಿಯನ್ನು ಹಿಂದೆ ಕೊಡಲಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ 18ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಡಿವಾಣ ಬಿತ್ತು. ಈಗೇನಿದ್ದರೂ ಫಲಪುಷ್ಪಗಳ ಅರ್ಚನೆ, ಹಣ್ಣು ಹೂವು ಸಮರ್ಪಣೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮಾಡಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಗೋಪುರ ಕಂಡು ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಹೊರಗಿನಿಂದ 'ವಿಮಾನವನ್ನು' ಕಾಣಬಹುದು. ಒಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಲವು ಸಣ್ಣ ಮೂರ್ತಿಗಳಿದ್ದು ಅಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಪೂಜೆ ಪುನಸ್ಕಾರಗಳು ಜರುಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣೆ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಿಂದ ಹೊರಹೋಗುವಾಗ ಶ್ರೀ ಆಂಜನೇಯಸ್ವಾಮಿ ದೇವರ ದರ್ಶನವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events5/banners/afdcbee84c6e1c386f062111c3a32fda142f1402b9a8a05b1af445a22d354360-rimg-w842-h960-gmir.jpg?v=1655437444",0.010,""

Posiblemente es el trekking que más se adentra en el corazón del Himalaya: el recorrido pasa por aldeas gurung y, paulatinamente, se adentra por el valle del río Modi hasta el espectacular \"Santuario de los Annapurnas\", lugar sagrado para los nepalís, un magnifico circo glaciar flanqueado por catorce cumbres e más de siete mil metros de altitud, entre ellas el Annapurna I de 8.091 m. (Esto es solo una pre-inscripción y para el venidero mes de marzo ya tendremos más datos fiables de recorrido, precios, vuelos, etc. y con ellos haremos un completo programa que solo remitiremos a los inscritos previamente)

Toda una aventura. Con el buen sabor de boca que nos dejó hace un par de años, previo a la pandemia, nuestro trekking al Campamento Base del Everest nos lleva a intentar, si el covid nos lo permite, nuestra segunda incursión o trekking por Nepal, sus montañas y su cultura.

The two-day event is six and a half hours each day, from 10am to 4:30pm on Saturday and Sunday. It will be hosted at a venue TBA in Mumbai. This workshop will be taught by Master Instructor Swetha Devaraj.

TO REGISTER CONTACT KEZBAN KLEIN ON WHATSAPP +91-98453-94872.

L1 is an intensive two-day workshop (13 hours total) where you’ll learn all 30 Level 1 moves, including regressions, progressions, and variations for all skill levels. You’ll explore how and when to use each movement individually, as well as how to link them together into flows of your own design.

The workshop is open to fitness professionals and non-professionals, as we welcome everyone interested in becoming a better mover. Fitness professionals are eligible to become Certified AF Instructors, who are allowed to teach AF in personal training, group fitness classes, or other fitness programs. Becoming certified requires completing the test process after the workshop. Non-professionals all welcome to take the course for their own benefit, but are not authorized to teach it without first attaining an appropriate fitness credential. 

ABOUT THE COURSE
You’ll cover all 6 components of Animal Flow, including the Traveling Forms (the “ABCs” of animal movements); Switches and Transitions; Wrist Mobility; Activations; Form Specific Stretches, and, of course, Flows.

The workshop starts with base positions, which systematically build in difficulty and complexity over the two days. Movements are taught within the context of scientifically-based concepts relevant to anyone working in health and fitness industries. By the end of the second day, the entire class will be performing a sequence known as the Beast flow which integrates a large majority of the movements from the workshop. This becomes a structure from which they may begin their own creative practice.

Find more details about the Level 1 Workshop here, including the specific movements covered in the workshop, the course objectives, and the test-out process.

WHAT’S INCLUDED
Your registration includes:

Complimentary access the full library of instructional videos for all Level 1 movements

L'ESPERIENZA:
Vieni con noi in un’ Avventura indimenticabile, tra Valli, Vette e antichi Monasteri, città gioiello... accompagnati da una guida esperta come Riccardo Fai, Patrizia Kunga Lhamo e la saggia presenza dal Monaco Tibetano Lama Janchup. 
Un Pellegrinaggio-Avventura emozionante, partendo dalle regioni Mistiche Himalayane ai confini del Mondo, sino alla città meravigliosa di Jaipur, passando da Delhi incredibile metropoli!

Alcune informazioni sul nostro Viaggio:
Come è per noi ormai consuetudine, anche quest'anno la proposta vuole far felice chi da un Viaggio si attende non solo lo svago di una bella vacanza, ma ne cerca soprattutto la profondità, in un’ Esperienza interiore ricca, sorprendente e indimenticabile.

Questo non è un Viaggio turistico, è qualcosa di molto di più... è un'Avventura Memorabile, una perla unica, da vivere con il cuore aperto. Andremo verso le Alte Energie, in Luoghi dove di solito il turismo di massa non arriva. Incontreremo personalmente l'Oracolo del Ladakh (riconosciuto dal Dalai Lama), un' anziana sciamana in grado, con un Rituale, di fornirci delle risposte importanti.
Faremo un trekking (facile per tutti) per arrivare su una montagna Sacra nel cuore del Kashmir, dove dormiremo una notte con la tenda corcondati dalla Bellezza e Purezza della natura accanto ad un piccolo prezioso antico monastero.
Avremo la possibilità di conoscere da vicino nobili culture e tradizioni, favorendo l’aspetto del Sacro e della meditazione. Staremo inoltre 2 giorni in completo ritiro spirituale, per imparare la meditazione in un Centro Buddista nel Ladakh.
E non ci priveremo di certo di alcuni momenti di gioia e divertimento condivisi tra i mille mercati di strada, gustose cene nei locali tradizionali, passeggiate da sogno e serate spensierate a sorseggiare Chai.
Un esperienza mistica memorabile!
Passeremo poi una giornata e una notte a Jaipur, meravigliosa città gioiello, e due giorni nella capitale dell'India, Delhi con i suoi mille contrasti, tra stupimento e gioia.

GRUPPO CON POSTI LIMITATI.

This amazing trail route around Satkania Hills will take in the most spectacular views of Outstanding Natural Beauty including long reaching views .The quiet scenic routes will overload your senses with constant mountain and wildlife making it one of the Satkania's best kept secret trail runs. This well-crafted road route will guide you around the perimeter of the Satkania. The route is run at low tide as it includes a small section of the foreshore giving a unique running experience.


A trail marathon is not the same as a road marathon. Because your mile speed is influenced more by the terrain than anything else, a trial run allows you to move outside the pace/splits construct of a road race. It has its own set of problems, such as different elevation differences, varied strength demands, and less aid on the course. While there are positives (such as less stress on your body compared to running on pavement and more scenery), it also has its own set of challenges.


*Transportation system: Chittagong to the race venue and race venue to Chittagong. 
*Camping:  A camping will be arranged before the race day for all participants. There will be a night stay in a tent. Besides that, we will provide washroom facilities. The campground is located in the valley of hill tracts, with a view of the moon from there. In addition, the landscape view is beautiful. 
*Food and Water arrangements:  There will be food arrangements for two days and natural resources for water.

Insieme al coordinamento del dott.

Non mancheranno le attività di svago, visite guidate per scoprire cultura e tradizioni dell’India oltre a momenti di relax presso il magnifico e lussuosissimo Resort in perfetto stile Rajastano con le pietre a vista tipiche della cultura locale, immerso nella natura con ampie camere lussureggianti in stile etnico, nel quale saremo ospitati a pochi passi dal Centro di Naturopatia, sede della scuola Acupressure Science dove si svolgeranno gran parte delle attività.

Kilka lat temu miałam okazję poprowadzić wyjazd dla kobiet w Indiach. Była to praca, zlecenie dla kogoś. Pamiętam, że moja pierwsza reakcja była taka, że skoro same dziewczyny to będzie nudno. Byłam wtedy przekonana, że wyjazdy mieszane to jedyna recepta dobrej zabawy. Och jak ja mało wiedziałam ?. Wyjazd ten wspominam jako mój najlepszy a przyjaźnie trwają do dziś. 

Pomysł jest taki że jedziemy w 4 miejsca. Zaczynamy na Goa, nad oceanem. Dużo słońca, niekończące się plaże, ciepły ocean, dużo nowych wrażeń. Dalej ruszymy w głąb lądu do Hampi - magicznej krainy głazów polodowcowych. Z tamtąd nocnym autobusem do Gokarny, świętego miasta Shivy nad oceanem. Ostatni przystanek to eko plantacja w środku dżungli z cudowmym naturalnym basenem. Odwidzimy wodospad, nauczymy się gotować lokalne potrawy i pędzić bimber z orzechów nerkowca ?

2 tygodnie - 4 miejsca. Gwarantuję duże dawki słońca, kąpieli, odpoczynku, dobrej zabawy, pysznego jedzenia i przygody.
No i czary, czary Indii, które każda z was poczuje inaczej ?


Proponowany termin wyjazdu  11. 02 - 25.02 2023 (+/- 1 dzień w zależności od ceny biletu) 

Szczegółowy plan wyjazdu:

Dzień 1 (11.02) Wylot z Polski. 

Dzień 2 (12.02)  Przylot do Delhi. Przesiadka na lokalny lot na Goa ( ok 2h). Transfer z lotniska Dabolim do hotelu przy plaży. Relaks po podróży. Wspólne wyjście do restauracji. Omówimy pierwsze wrażenia i parę innych spraw :) 

Dzień 3 (13.02) Czas na relaks, pierwsza kąpiel w morzu, plażowanie. Zjemy wspólnie śniadanie. Opowiem wam trochę o miejscu, gdzie iść, gdzie jeść, na co zwrócić uwagę. Codziennie po południu dla chetnych długi spacer po plaży. Cudowne zachody słońca nad oceanem Indyjskim.  Wieczorem wspólną kolacja. 

Dzień 4 (14.02) Odpoczywamy. Śniadanie kapiele w morzu. Dużo, dużo słońca ☀ Temperarura wody w lutym to ok 28 stopni. Można skorzystać z zajęć nauki surfingu, pójść na masaż, polatać na paralotni, wypożyczyć skuter, pójść na zakupy. Wieczorem wybierzemy się na koncert. 

Dzień 5 (15.02) Śniadanie. Kolejny dzień nad oceanem indyjskim. Wieczorem ognisko na plaży. 

Dzień 6 (16.02) Pakowanie plecaków. Około południa wymeldowanie z pokoju. Wieczorem wyruszamy nocnym autobusem do Hampi. Podróż niezapomniana bo udamy się tam tzw. \" sleeperem\" czyli autobusem z łóżkami. Jedziemy ok 10h...To przygoda sama w sobie :) 

Dzień 7 (17.02) Po przyjeździe wcześnie rano zakwaterowanie w hotelu. Odpoczynek. Wspólne śniadanie. W ciągu dnia wybierzemy się na zwiedzanie okolicy. Wieczorem pojedziemy rikshami na niezapomniany zachód słońca w miejscu narodzin Hanumana - boga małp. Przepiękny widok z góry i towarzyszące mu gangi małp złodziejek :) 

Dzień 8 (18.02) Dziś po śniadaniu zwiedzamy resztę okolicy. Odwiedzimy główną świątynię miasta poświęconą Shivie gdzie największą atrakcją od lat jest słonica Laxmi. Ruiny miasta zajmują przestrzeń 26 km kwadratowych. Dla chętnych zainteresowanych jest opcja wycieczki rikshami, w celu odwiedzenia najciekawszych punktów w stosunkowo krótkim czasie : pałace, stajnie dla słoni, wartownie, świątynie i filarowy bazar do dziś spełniający swoją funkcję handlową.
Wieczorem wspólna kolacja. 

Dzień 9 (19.02) Dzień luźny, czas na zakupy, przechadzki wzdłuż rzeki. Wieczorem wyruszamy do Gokarny znanym już wam autobusem sypialnym. 

Dzień 10 (20.02) Witajcie w Gokarnie! To malownicze miasteczko to jeden z głównych ośrodków kultu Shivy. Miasto rozpościerające się nad brzegiem siedmiokilometrowej plaży codziennie odwiedzają setki pielgrzymów z całych Indii. Będzie okazja przyjrzeć się rytuałom i obrzędom w autentycznym wydaniu, tu zobaczymy \"prawdziwe\" Indie. Zatrzymamy się w chatkach przy plaży pośród drzew kokosowych.

Dzień 11 (21.02) Rano wybierzemy się do miasteczka. Małe restauracje uliczne serwują autentyczne południowoindyjskie jedzenie, bardzo różne od tego, które podaje się turystom na plaży. Wzdłuż głównych ulic miasta ciągną się stoiska pełne towarów zarówno dla pielgrzymów z Indii jak i turystów z zachodu. 

Dzień 12 (22.02) Dziś zapraszam was na spacer plażami. Przejdziemy wszystkie pięć plaż podzielonych klifami. Piękne widoki, kąpiel na każdej plaży, lunch, zachód słońca. Powrót łodziami lub autobusem do miasta.

Dzień 13 (23.02) Śniadanie, plaża. Ok 11 jedziemy pociagiem na Goa. Z głównej stacji na Goa taxi zabierze nas w głąb lądu, do dżungli, gdzie spedzimy dwie ostatnie noce wyjazdu. Zatrzymany się na 20 ha plantacji przypraw, nerkowców i kokosów. Do dyspozycji mamy naturalny basen z krystalicznie czystą wodą. 

Dzień 14 (24.02) Przepyszne śniadanie przyrządzone z lokalnych produktów plantacji. Wyjazd na wodospad. 


Dzień 15 (25.02) W zależności od godzin przelotu zaplanujemy godzinę wyjazdu na lotnisko na Goa. Lokalny lot Goa-Delhi. 
W razie dużej luki czasowej pomiędzy lotami zabukuje hotel przy lotnisku W Delhi. 
Wylot z Delhi do Warszawy. W ten sam dzień jesteście w Warszawie. 

Kto jedzie z nami: 
Zapraszam wszystkie dziewczyny, kobiety, córki, mamy, babcie :) Ważna jest otwartość i elastyczność.W Indiach działa powiedzenie \"najlepszy plan to brak planu\". I tu nie zrozumcie mnie źle, my plan mamy ale moc Indii z pewnością będzie nas testować przy jego realizacji.  Wyjazd nie wymaga specjalnej sprawności fizycznej. Minimalna wielkość grupy to 5 osób, maksymalna 12 osób.

Spiritual Retreat in India

Yoga, Meditation och Ayurveda med Govind Radhakrishnan
Följ med på en unik resa till magiska Arunachala

Hit har spirituella sökare letat sig sedan urminnes tider. Det är en speciell energi runt det heliga berget Arunachala som ligger vid staden Tiruvannamalai. Här finns även många intressanta ashrams som vi kommer att besöka och även meditera i.

Du får ta del av det genuina Indien långt från turistvägarna. Govind guidar oss med sin djupa kunskap om indien, kulturen och spiritualitet genom tempel, meditationsgrottor, bergsutflykt och en speciell giri valam, en pilgrimstur runt berget, gåendes och med oxvagn. Vi får besöka många platser och träffa sadhus på ett sätt som vi aldrig haft möjlighet till utan Govind. Han har själv mediterat i området sedan han var tonåring och har med sitt ödmjuka och entusiastiska sätt mycket att dela.

Det är en resa lika mycket i det färgsprakande yttre som i ditt djupaste inre väsen. Vi yogar, mediterar och får satsangs (föreläsningar) om ayurveda, yogans olika vägar och mycket mycket mer. Var och en får i början av retreatet en individuell session med Govind där du får råd utifrån din unika ayurvediska konstitution.

Vi bor och yogar på hotellet Arunai Anantha. Här har vi helpension och äter god och näringsrik vegetarisk indisk mat som Govind specialbeställt så det blir bra ayurvediskt för oss alla. Han berättar även om maten vi äter vid måltiderna. Det finns caféer och restauranger om man vill på egen hand äta ute. Vi rekommenderar de som är trygga att äta på. Vi kommer även att ha förmånen att äta i några ashrams som vi besöker. Hotellet ligger 5 minuter med Riksha till staden, det är billigt och vill man kan man dela en riksha. Annars går det bra att ta en promenad.

Yogan gör vi utomhus på hotellets shala varje morgon, yogan är enkel och hjälper oss att öppna upp eventuella blockeringar i kroppen. Det är klassisk indisk yoga ledd av Govind med fokus på vårt inre.

Ta chansen och följ med på en mycket fin och speciell resa och i fotspåren av många spirituella mästare bland annat Ramana Maharshi.

AnneSophie Sjöblom följer med och assisterar Govind på resan.

Resan är ett samarbete mellan Yoga Devi och Santhi Yoga.

Några ord från tidigare deltagare:

“Being taught yoga, pranayama and meditation the traditional yogic way, and the opportunity to meet and have satsang with authentic Yogis, Swamis and Vedic priest is a rare luxury. A gold mine for spiritual seekers.”

Anders Haldin, 43, Graphical designer &amp; animator

“The spiritual atmosphere of the mountain of Arunachala was definitely the biggest experience for me. Arunachala is a great place to be, one of the finest and most spiritual places in India. It has a special atmosphere that promotes mindfulness.”

Morten Steiniche, 45, Journalist

various reasons. Some say that it was named after a 
demon king named “Jalandhara.” And some say that it 
derives its name from the Hindi word Jalandhar which 
means they are inside the water referring to the area lying

जालंधर, जेएनएन। इतिहास धार्मिक जगत को कभी-कभी ऐसे मोड़ पर लाकर खड़ा कर देता है, जिसके आगे अंधविश्वास और पीछे विज्ञान दिखाई देने लगता है। जैसे-जैसे मनुष्य तरक्की कर रहा है, वैसे-वैसे उसकी आस्था की जड़ें कमजोर होती जा रही हैं। आज तक कुछ लोगों में आस्था, श्रद्धा और विश्वास कैसे पूरी मजबूती से खड़ा है, यह जालंधर के एकमात्र सोढल मेले को देखकर आश्चर्य होता है।

संसार में मानव और भुजंग का रिश्ता अनादि काल से चला आ रहा है, तभी तो भगवान शंकर के श्रृंगार में सर्प भी अनिवार्य रूप से दिखाया जाता है। भगवान विष्णु शेष पर क्षीर सागर में विश्राम करते चित्रों में प्राय: देखे गए हैं। भगवान विष्णु के शेषनाग का नाम धार्मिक ग्रंथों में अनंत हैं। नाग देवता जहां भी पूजे जाते हैं, अनंत रूप में ही माने जाते हैं। अनंत चौदस के दिवस नाग रूप में प्रकट हुए बाबा सोढल का विशाल मेला लगने लगा। कथा वही है जो जनश्रुति में लोगों तक पहुंची। चड्ढा और आनंद परिवारों से संबंधित बाबा सोढल के बारे में बहुत से चमत्कारों की कथाएं सुनने को मिलती हैं।

Ads by Jagran.TV
पहले-पहल यह मेला अनंत चौदस के पूर्व अर्धरात्रि से आरंभ होकर अगले दिन बारह बजे तक समाप्त हो जाता था। चड्ढा परिवार अपनी श्रद्धा से बैंड-बाजे के साथ नवजात शिशुओं एवं नवविवाहित जोड़ों के साथ इस पावन तीर्थ पर आया करते हैं। लौह परिवार के ब्राह्मण को विधिवत पूजा करने का अधिकार रहा है। आज से कुछ दशक पूर्व इस पावन मंदिर पर कुछ मतभेद उभरे, तब पंजाब सरकार ने धारा 145 लगा कर एक सरकारी अधिकारी को मंदिर का प्रबंध सौंप दिया था। तब बाबा सोढल के श्रद्धालुओं ने मंदिर के आगे, मुख्य प्रवेश द्वार के सामने बाबा जी की एक और प्रतिमा स्थापित कर दी। अब भक्तजन दोनों स्थानों पर शीश नवाते हैं।


भारत में ब्रह्मा जी के मात्र तीन-चार ही मंदिर हैं। इनमें से एक है पुष्कर राज, जिन्हें धरती के नेत्र कहा जाता है। इसके अतिरिक्त जालंधर का ब्रह्मकुंड ब्रह्मा जी का एक महत्त्वपूर्ण तीर्थ है। ब्रह्मकुंड में खुदाई होने से अब एक प्राचीन कुंड के दर्शन होने लगे हैं। नानकशाही ईंटों से बना यह कुंड धीरे-धीरे इतिहास में अपनी मौजूदगी दर्ज करा रहा है। अब इस कुंड में जल नहीं है। इसलिए इसके पवित्र जल के दर्शन वहां नहीं होते। ब्रह्मकुंड के समीप ब्रह्मा जी का मंदिर है। कहा जाता है कि भगवान शंकर ने एक बार नाराज होकर कहा था कि ब्रह्मा जी का अधिक पूजन नहीं होगा।

ब्रह्मकुंड को लेकर भिन्न-भिन्न धारणाएं
जालंधर में ब्रह्मकुंड किस शताब्दी में बना, इसके बारे में भी इतिहास की भिन्न-भिन्न धारणाएं हैं। जो भी हो यह महाभारत काल से पूर्व का बना माना जाता है। कुछ इतिहासकार मानते हैं कि इसके निकट अर्जुन और बब्रुवाहन के बीच भीषण युद्ध हुआ था, जिसमें अर्जुन पराजित हो गए थे। क्योंकि बब्रुवाहन ने इसी तालाब यानि कुंड का अमृत जल ग्रहण किया हुआ था। अभी इस कुंड के बारे में बहुत शोध की अवश्यकता है। एक किंवदंती के अनुसार ब्रह्मकुंड का जल धरती से स्वत: प्रकट हुआ था। इसका जल ग्रीष्म ऋतु में भी शीतल हुआ करता था। इस ब्रह्मकुंड की मौजूदगी द्वापर युग के कुछ ग्रंथों से मिलती है।

..HISTORY OF SHRI SIDH BABA SODAL MANDIR...
                        BY-Shri Sidh Baba Sodal Trust
India is a holy land of fairs and festivals. Thousands of such events are celebrated in form of sacred gatherings and with different rituals. Such is a fair celebrated on Anant Chodas in Jalandhar, state Punjab. More than one and half million devotees mark their presence for paying obeisance to an immortal legend named Baba Sodal. People from all religion creed and cast attend the festivities with full and show in pursuit of justifying the fulfilled blessings at this holy place.
It is assumed that woman used a pound of water for meeting domestic requirements like washing cloths and so on. The holy mother of legendary Baba Sodal (in his early childhood) accompanied her son to pound. The child started playing mischives by making clay balls and throwing at her mother. When utterly disturbed, mother cursed the son badly. Baba Sodal made her mother repeat the rebuking words and then in pursuit of obeying her he jumped into the pound and never reappeared. By hearing hue and cry of mother people gathered. After Relentless search there was no sign of the boy.
It is said that the child appeared in the form of holy snake and declared his farewell from this mortal world. He also demanded his reincarnation should be accepted by Chadha and Anand families and should be offered Mathi (local flour made snake) called “Topa”. Baba ji declared that he is descendents from Chadha clan. So his part of “Topa” weighing two and quarter ‘Ser’(an old measurement unit) and for each Chadha boy half ‘Ser’. He further said “topa” should be weight against each member of bachelor brahmin’s family. It can be consumed only by members of Chadha clan, even their son in laws not allowed to have the share of “Topa”. On Amawasya ( no moon night) before Sodal fair head of Chadha clan visits the pond and extracts clay fourteen times for his each son. This means to make Baba Ji appear on the day of Tryodashi (13th of local month). Every member pays his obeisence to Sodal Baba , Kasar (kneading of simple flour) is made and offered forteen times gradually in parts. On Chaturdashi (14th of local month) all members of Chadha clan eat only fried food especially made from a traditional fry pan. Eight days ahead of this festival all members of Chadha clan sow ‘Kheti’ on the name of Baba Ji which means the more prosper the sow, happier and richer will be the family.
There are few other things worth mentioning:
1.) Mundan ceremony (1st ceremonial hair cut according to Hindu Religon) of each Chadha boy is conducted on 2nd Navratra when the boy is 3 years old.
2.) Till completion of all marriage rituals off Chadha groom, it is mandatory for bride to stay with Baba ji’s holy Sandals , then only she is accepted as a new member of family. These all declarations are made by Baba Ji himself. He further announced that he will continue to be offered prayers even during crisis in the family. Otherwise he would remind the disobedience by appearing in their dreams in the form of a snake. If disobeyed whole clan will be endangered with these words Baba ji disappeared in the pond. Ever since people from distant places visit the holy site every year to offer their prayers.

ಹಿಂದೆ ಚಿಕ್ಕದೊಂದು ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಿದ್ದು, ಕ್ರಮೇಣ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಹೊಂದಿ, ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಪ್ರಾಮುಖ್ಯತೆ ಗಳಿಸಿ, ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವೆಂಬ ದೊಡ್ಡ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಾಗಿ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯಾಗಿದೆ ಎಂದು ತಿಳಿದುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. 1799 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಧಿಕಾರಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರು ಈ ದೇವಿ ಅರಾಧಕರಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಶ್ರಧ್ದಾ ಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಪಡಿಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ದೊಡ್ಡದಾದ ದೇವಾಲಯವನ್ನಾಗಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಹಾಗೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಮಹತ್ವ ತಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಬೆಟ್ಟ ಚಾರಿತ್ರಿಕ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ, ವಿಜಯನಗರ ಹಾಗೂ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರ ಕೊಡುಗೆಯಿದೆ. 12ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ ದೊರೆ ವಿಷ್ಣುವರ್ಧನ ಹಾಗೂ 17ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ವಿಜಯನಗರದ ಅರಸರ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯನ್ನು ಗುರುತಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಕ್ರಿ.ಶ. 1573 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರು ದೇವಿಯನ್ನು ಪೂಜಿಸಲು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾಗ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಸಿಡಿಲು ಬಡಿದು ಅವರ ತಲೆಯ ಕೂದಲೆಲ್ಲಾ ಉದುರಿ ಹೋದವೆಂದು ಇತಿಹಾಸ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ.
ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ ಚೌಕಾಕೃತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣವಾಗಿದೆ. ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಟ್ಟಲಾಗಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ, ಹೆಬ್ಬಾಗಿಲು, ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರ, ನವರಂಗ, ಅಂತರಾಳ, ಗರ್ಭಗೃಹ, ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಕಾರಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಸುಂದರವಾದ `ಗೋಪುರ` ಮತ್ತು ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ 'ವಿಮಾನ' ಶಿಖರಗಳಿವೆ. ಏಳು ಅಂತಸ್ತುಗಳ ಗೋಪುರ 19ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದು ಪಿರಮಿಡ್ ಆಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದೆ. ಶಿಖರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಏಳು ಚಿನ್ನದ ಲೇಪಿತ ಕಲಶಗಳಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಹಿಷಮರ್ಧಿನಿಯಾದ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ವಿರಾಜಮಾನವಾಗಿದೆ. ಎಂಟು ಭುಜಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸೀನಳಾಗಿದ್ದಾಳೆ. ಈ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಪುರಾತನವಾದದ್ದು. ಈ ಶಿಲಾಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಮಾರ್ಖಂಡೇಯ ಋಷಿಗಳು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿದರೆಂದು ಸ್ಥಳ ಪುರಾಣ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ. 1827 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜಒಡೆಯರು ಸಾವಿರ ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೂ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಜೀರ್ಣೋಧ್ದಾರ ಮಾಡಿ ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಈ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಗೋಪುರವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಸಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹವಾಹನ' ಒಂದನ್ನು ಮರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸಿ ಕೊಡುಗೆ ನೀಡಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹ ವಾಹನ' ವನ್ನು ರಥೋತ್ಸವ ಸಂಧರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಸಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವಿಯ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನಿಟ್ಟು ರಥವನ್ನು ಎಳೆಯಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ಗಣಪತಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವನ್ನು ನೋಡಬಹುದು. ದ್ವಾರದ ಬೃಹತ್ ಮರದ ಬಾಗಿಲನ್ನು ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ತಗಡಿನಿಂದ ಹೊದಿಸಲಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ಬಾಗಿಲಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಹಲವು ಸ್ವರೂಪಗಳನ್ನು ತೋರಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಕೆಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಂದ್ರಾದಿ ಅಷ್ಠದಿಕ್ಪಾಲಕರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ.
ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದಿಂದ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋದರೆ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಸಣ್ಣ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ. ವಿಘ್ನರಾಜನಿಗೆ ನಮಿಸಿ ಕೆಲವು ಕಲ್ಲಿನ ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಹತ್ತಿಹೋದರೆ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಬಲಿಪೀಠ ಮತ್ತು ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭ ಕಂಡುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಬಲಿಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇವೆರಡರ ಮುಂಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಅಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ನಂದಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದೆ. ಮಾತೆ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯನ್ನು ಅದು ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸುತ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿದೆ. ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭಕ್ಕೆ ಈಶಾನ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಗೋಡೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಆಂಜನೇಯನ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದ್ದು ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ನಿತ್ಯ ಪೂಜೆ ಜರುಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಂದಿನಿ ಮತ್ತು ಕಮಲಿನಿ ಎಂಬ ದ್ವಾರಪಾಲಿಕೆಯರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳು ದ್ವಾರದ ಎಡ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಮುಂಚೆ ಇರುವ ಅತರಾಳದ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುದ್ದಾದ ಗಣಪಡತಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ. ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯ ಪಂಚಲೋಹದ ಸುಂದರ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯಿದೆ. ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಕ್ತನ ದಿರಿಸು ತೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರ ಆರು ಅಡಿ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸುಂದರ ಭಕ್ತ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಕಾಣಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರು ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂವರು ಪತ್ನಿಯರೊಂದಿಗೆ ದೇವಿಗೆ ಕೈಮುಗಿದು ನಿಂತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರ ಎಡಭಾಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂತಿರುವವರೆಂದರೆ ರಮಾವಿಲಾಸ, ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿವಿಲಾಸ ಮತ್ತು ಕೃಷ್ಣವಿಲಾಸ ಮಹಾರಾಣಿಯರು. ಇವರುಗಳ ಶಿಲಾ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳ ಪಾದದ ಬಳಿಯ ಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ಇವರುಗಳ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನು ಕೆತ್ತಲಾಗಿದೆ.
ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಅರ್ಚಕರು ತಾಯಿ ಸ್ವರೂಪದ ಶಿಲಾ ಪ್ರತಿಮೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿ ದಿನ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಿ ಪೂಜೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಯದುಕುಲದ ದೇವತೆಯಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆದು ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಗೆ ಮೈಸೂರಿನ ಮಹಾರಾಜರುಗಳು ಹಲವಾರು ಬೆಲೆಬಾಳುವ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಪರೂಪವಾದ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಶ್ರಧ್ಧಾಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಒಪ್ಪಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈ ಶಕ್ತಿ ದೇವತೆಗೆ ಮಾನವ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಬಲಿಯನ್ನು ಹಿಂದೆ ಕೊಡಲಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ 18ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಡಿವಾಣ ಬಿತ್ತು. ಈಗೇನಿದ್ದರೂ ಫಲಪುಷ್ಪಗಳ ಅರ್ಚನೆ, ಹಣ್ಣು ಹೂವು ಸಮರ್ಪಣೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮಾಡಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಗೋಪುರ ಕಂಡು ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಹೊರಗಿನಿಂದ 'ವಿಮಾನವನ್ನು' ಕಾಣಬಹುದು. ಒಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಲವು ಸಣ್ಣ ಮೂರ್ತಿಗಳಿದ್ದು ಅಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಪೂಜೆ ಪುನಸ್ಕಾರಗಳು ಜರುಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣೆ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಿಂದ ಹೊರಹೋಗುವಾಗ ಶ್ರೀ ಆಂಜನೇಯಸ್ವಾಮಿ ದೇವರ ದರ್ಶನವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events4/banners/8e562042fefb56d245fa9c6375435c86460608300fe5feaf1051c90f10806c04-rimg-w512-h640-gmir?v=1645044329",12.910,""

ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದಿಂದ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋದರೆ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಸಣ್ಣ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ. ವಿಘ್ನರಾಜನಿಗೆ ನಮಿಸಿ ಕೆಲವು ಕಲ್ಲಿನ ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಹತ್ತಿಹೋದರೆ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಬಲಿಪೀಠ ಮತ್ತು ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭ ಕಂಡುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಬಲಿಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇವೆರಡರ ಮುಂಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಅಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ನಂದಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದೆ. ಮಾತೆ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯನ್ನು ಅದು ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸುತ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿದೆ. ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭಕ್ಕೆ ಈಶಾನ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಗೋಡೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಆಂಜನೇಯನ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದ್ದು ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ನಿತ್ಯ ಪೂಜೆ ಜರುಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಂದಿನಿ ಮತ್ತು ಕಮಲಿನಿ ಎಂಬ ದ್ವಾರಪಾಲಿಕೆಯರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳು ದ್ವಾರದ ಎಡ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಮುಂಚೆ ಇರುವ ಅತರಾಳದ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುದ್ದಾದ ಗಣಪಡತಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ. ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯ ಪಂಚಲೋಹದ ಸುಂದರ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯಿದೆ. ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಕ್ತನ ದಿರಿಸು ತೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರ ಆರು ಅಡಿ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸುಂದರ ಭಕ್ತ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಕಾಣಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರು ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂವರು ಪತ್ನಿಯರೊಂದಿಗೆ ದೇವಿಗೆ ಕೈಮುಗಿದು ನಿಂತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರ ಎಡಭಾಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂತಿರುವವರೆಂದರೆ ರಮಾವಿಲಾಸ, ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿವಿಲಾಸ ಮತ್ತು ಕೃಷ್ಣವಿಲಾಸ ಮಹಾರಾಣಿಯರು. ಇವರುಗಳ ಶಿಲಾ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳ ಪಾದದ ಬಳಿಯ ಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ಇವರುಗಳ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನು ಕೆತ್ತಲಾಗಿದೆ.
ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಅರ್ಚಕರು ತಾಯಿ ಸ್ವರೂಪದ ಶಿಲಾ ಪ್ರತಿಮೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿ ದಿನ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಿ ಪೂಜೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಯದುಕುಲದ ದೇವತೆಯಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆದು ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಗೆ ಮೈಸೂರಿನ ಮಹಾರಾಜರುಗಳು ಹಲವಾರು ಬೆಲೆಬಾಳುವ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಪರೂಪವಾದ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಶ್ರಧ್ಧಾಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಒಪ್ಪಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈ ಶಕ್ತಿ ದೇವತೆಗೆ ಮಾನವ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಬಲಿಯನ್ನು ಹಿಂದೆ ಕೊಡಲಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ 18ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಡಿವಾಣ ಬಿತ್ತು. ಈಗೇನಿದ್ದರೂ ಫಲಪುಷ್ಪಗಳ ಅರ್ಚನೆ, ಹಣ್ಣು ಹೂವು ಸಮರ್ಪಣೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮಾಡಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಗೋಪುರ ಕಂಡು ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಹೊರಗಿನಿಂದ 'ವಿಮಾನವನ್ನು' ಕಾಣಬಹುದು. ಒಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಲವು ಸಣ್ಣ ಮೂರ್ತಿಗಳಿದ್ದು ಅಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಪೂಜೆ ಪುನಸ್ಕಾರಗಳು ಜರುಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣೆ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಿಂದ ಹೊರಹೋಗುವಾಗ ಶ್ರೀ ಆಂಜನೇಯಸ್ವಾಮಿ ದೇವರ ದರ್ಶನವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events4/banners/8e562042fefb56d245fa9c6375435c86460608300fe5feaf1051c90f10806c04-rimg-w768-h960-gmir?v=1654968598",12.910,""

A túra útvonala: Dél-Haa atoll - Shaviyani atoll - Raa atoll - Baa atoll - Észak-Malé atoll.
A Soleil-2 egy 150 lábas üvegszállas hajó, amely 14 tágas kabinnal rendelkezik. A fedélközben hat 11 nm-es kétágyas kabin, a főfedélzeten két 25 nm-es Master-kabin, és a felső fedélzeten hat 15 nm-es, saját erkéllyel is rendelkező duplaágyas Delux-kabin található. Természetesen minden kabin saját fürdőszobával és légkondicionálóval rendelkezik.
A tágas klimatizált szalonban tálalják a napi három változatos étkezést és itt tartják a merülések előtti eligazításokat is.
A fedélzeten van egy kis bolt, ahol mindenféle apróság mellett csapolt sört, rövid italokat, nassolni valót is árulnak.
A búvárkodás a kísérőhajóról történik, amit a helyi nyelven Dhoni-nak neveznek. Itt tároljuk a buvárfelszerelést, a palackok töltése is itt történik. A dhoni Nitrox membránnal felszerelt, így a Nitrox végzettséggel rendelkező búvárok felár nélkül élvezhetik a Nitrox-merülés előnyeit.
További részletek (angol nyelven) itt találhatók: https://www.blueksafari.com.mv/liveaboard/Soleil-2
A helyek ára 1.700 és 1.870 USD között alakul a választott kabintól függően. Az ár nem tartalmazza: a 150 USD szervízdíjat, 15l-es palack vagy felszerelés bérlést, kisbolti fogyasztást.
A Maldív-szigetekre legkésőbb 2022.12.10-én 12:00 óráig kell megérkezni. Igénybe veszünk egy belföldi repülőjáratot, melynek költsége kb. 250 USD/fő.

ಹಿಂದೆ ಚಿಕ್ಕದೊಂದು ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಿದ್ದು, ಕ್ರಮೇಣ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಹೊಂದಿ, ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಪ್ರಾಮುಖ್ಯತೆ ಗಳಿಸಿ, ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವೆಂಬ ದೊಡ್ಡ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಾಗಿ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯಾಗಿದೆ ಎಂದು ತಿಳಿದುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. 1799 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಧಿಕಾರಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರು ಈ ದೇವಿ ಅರಾಧಕರಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಶ್ರಧ್ದಾ ಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಪಡಿಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ದೊಡ್ಡದಾದ ದೇವಾಲಯವನ್ನಾಗಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಹಾಗೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಮಹತ್ವ ತಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಬೆಟ್ಟ ಚಾರಿತ್ರಿಕ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ, ವಿಜಯನಗರ ಹಾಗೂ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರ ಕೊಡುಗೆಯಿದೆ. 12ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ ದೊರೆ ವಿಷ್ಣುವರ್ಧನ ಹಾಗೂ 17ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ವಿಜಯನಗರದ ಅರಸರ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯನ್ನು ಗುರುತಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಕ್ರಿ.ಶ. 1573 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರು ದೇವಿಯನ್ನು ಪೂಜಿಸಲು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾಗ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಸಿಡಿಲು ಬಡಿದು ಅವರ ತಲೆಯ ಕೂದಲೆಲ್ಲಾ ಉದುರಿ ಹೋದವೆಂದು ಇತಿಹಾಸ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ.
ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ ಚೌಕಾಕೃತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣವಾಗಿದೆ. ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಟ್ಟಲಾಗಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ, ಹೆಬ್ಬಾಗಿಲು, ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರ, ನವರಂಗ, ಅಂತರಾಳ, ಗರ್ಭಗೃಹ, ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಕಾರಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಸುಂದರವಾದ `ಗೋಪುರ` ಮತ್ತು ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ 'ವಿಮಾನ' ಶಿಖರಗಳಿವೆ. ಏಳು ಅಂತಸ್ತುಗಳ ಗೋಪುರ 19ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದು ಪಿರಮಿಡ್ ಆಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದೆ. ಶಿಖರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಏಳು ಚಿನ್ನದ ಲೇಪಿತ ಕಲಶಗಳಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಹಿಷಮರ್ಧಿನಿಯಾದ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ವಿರಾಜಮಾನವಾಗಿದೆ. ಎಂಟು ಭುಜಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸೀನಳಾಗಿದ್ದಾಳೆ. ಈ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಪುರಾತನವಾದದ್ದು. ಈ ಶಿಲಾಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಮಾರ್ಖಂಡೇಯ ಋಷಿಗಳು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿದರೆಂದು ಸ್ಥಳ ಪುರಾಣ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ. 1827 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜಒಡೆಯರು ಸಾವಿರ ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೂ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಜೀರ್ಣೋಧ್ದಾರ ಮಾಡಿ ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಈ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಗೋಪುರವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಸಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹವಾಹನ' ಒಂದನ್ನು ಮರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸಿ ಕೊಡುಗೆ ನೀಡಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹ ವಾಹನ' ವನ್ನು ರಥೋತ್ಸವ ಸಂಧರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಸಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವಿಯ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನಿಟ್ಟು ರಥವನ್ನು ಎಳೆಯಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ಗಣಪತಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವನ್ನು ನೋಡಬಹುದು. ದ್ವಾರದ ಬೃಹತ್ ಮರದ ಬಾಗಿಲನ್ನು ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ತಗಡಿನಿಂದ ಹೊದಿಸಲಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ಬಾಗಿಲಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಹಲವು ಸ್ವರೂಪಗಳನ್ನು ತೋರಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಕೆಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಂದ್ರಾದಿ ಅಷ್ಠದಿಕ್ಪಾಲಕರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ.
ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದಿಂದ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋದರೆ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಸಣ್ಣ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ. ವಿಘ್ನರಾಜನಿಗೆ ನಮಿಸಿ ಕೆಲವು ಕಲ್ಲಿನ ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಹತ್ತಿಹೋದರೆ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಬಲಿಪೀಠ ಮತ್ತು ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭ ಕಂಡುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಬಲಿಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇವೆರಡರ ಮುಂಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಅಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ನಂದಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದೆ. ಮಾತೆ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯನ್ನು ಅದು ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸುತ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿದೆ. ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭಕ್ಕೆ ಈಶಾನ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಗೋಡೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಆಂಜನೇಯನ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದ್ದು ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ನಿತ್ಯ ಪೂಜೆ ಜರುಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಂದಿನಿ ಮತ್ತು ಕಮಲಿನಿ ಎಂಬ ದ್ವಾರಪಾಲಿಕೆಯರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳು ದ್ವಾರದ ಎಡ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಮುಂಚೆ ಇರುವ ಅತರಾಳದ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುದ್ದಾದ ಗಣಪಡತಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ. ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯ ಪಂಚಲೋಹದ ಸುಂದರ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯಿದೆ. ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಕ್ತನ ದಿರಿಸು ತೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರ ಆರು ಅಡಿ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸುಂದರ ಭಕ್ತ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಕಾಣಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರು ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂವರು ಪತ್ನಿಯರೊಂದಿಗೆ ದೇವಿಗೆ ಕೈಮುಗಿದು ನಿಂತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರ ಎಡಭಾಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂತಿರುವವರೆಂದರೆ ರಮಾವಿಲಾಸ, ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿವಿಲಾಸ ಮತ್ತು ಕೃಷ್ಣವಿಲಾಸ ಮಹಾರಾಣಿಯರು. ಇವರುಗಳ ಶಿಲಾ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳ ಪಾದದ ಬಳಿಯ ಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ಇವರುಗಳ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನು ಕೆತ್ತಲಾಗಿದೆ.
ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಅರ್ಚಕರು ತಾಯಿ ಸ್ವರೂಪದ ಶಿಲಾ ಪ್ರತಿಮೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿ ದಿನ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಿ ಪೂಜೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಯದುಕುಲದ ದೇವತೆಯಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆದು ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಗೆ ಮೈಸೂರಿನ ಮಹಾರಾಜರುಗಳು ಹಲವಾರು ಬೆಲೆಬಾಳುವ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಪರೂಪವಾದ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಶ್ರಧ್ಧಾಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಒಪ್ಪಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈ ಶಕ್ತಿ ದೇವತೆಗೆ ಮಾನವ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಬಲಿಯನ್ನು ಹಿಂದೆ ಕೊಡಲಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ 18ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಡಿವಾಣ ಬಿತ್ತು. ಈಗೇನಿದ್ದರೂ ಫಲಪುಷ್ಪಗಳ ಅರ್ಚನೆ, ಹಣ್ಣು ಹೂವು ಸಮರ್ಪಣೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮಾಡಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಗೋಪುರ ಕಂಡು ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಹೊರಗಿನಿಂದ 'ವಿಮಾನವನ್ನು' ಕಾಣಬಹುದು. ಒಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಲವು ಸಣ್ಣ ಮೂರ್ತಿಗಳಿದ್ದು ಅಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಪೂಜೆ ಪುನಸ್ಕಾರಗಳು ಜರುಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣೆ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಿಂದ ಹೊರಹೋಗುವಾಗ ಶ್ರೀ ಆಂಜನೇಯಸ್ವಾಮಿ ದೇವರ ದರ್ಶನವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events5/banners/ded30de688dba367f2a6651fe0214aa2ef2b76fbec6c66cdcc618f435e214131-rimg-w768-h960-gmir.jpg?v=1655965253",12.910,""

ಹಿಂದೆ ಚಿಕ್ಕದೊಂದು ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಿದ್ದು, ಕ್ರಮೇಣ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಹೊಂದಿ, ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಪ್ರಾಮುಖ್ಯತೆ ಗಳಿಸಿ, ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವೆಂಬ ದೊಡ್ಡ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವಾಗಿ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯಾಗಿದೆ ಎಂದು ತಿಳಿದುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. 1799 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಧಿಕಾರಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರು ಈ ದೇವಿ ಅರಾಧಕರಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಶ್ರಧ್ದಾ ಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಪಡಿಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ದೊಡ್ಡದಾದ ದೇವಾಲಯವನ್ನಾಗಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಹಾಗೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಮಹತ್ವ ತಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಬೆಟ್ಟ ಚಾರಿತ್ರಿಕ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ, ವಿಜಯನಗರ ಹಾಗೂ ಮೈಸೂರು ಅರಸರ ಕೊಡುಗೆಯಿದೆ. 12ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ಹೊಯ್ಸಳ ದೊರೆ ವಿಷ್ಣುವರ್ಧನ ಹಾಗೂ 17ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದ ವಿಜಯನಗರದ ಅರಸರ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯನ್ನು ಗುರುತಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಕ್ರಿ.ಶ. 1573 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರು ದೇವಿಯನ್ನು ಪೂಜಿಸಲು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾಗ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಸಿಡಿಲು ಬಡಿದು ಅವರ ತಲೆಯ ಕೂದಲೆಲ್ಲಾ ಉದುರಿ ಹೋದವೆಂದು ಇತಿಹಾಸ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ.
ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ ಚೌಕಾಕೃತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣವಾಗಿದೆ. ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಟ್ಟಲಾಗಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ, ಹೆಬ್ಬಾಗಿಲು, ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರ, ನವರಂಗ, ಅಂತರಾಳ, ಗರ್ಭಗೃಹ, ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಕಾರಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಸುಂದರವಾದ `ಗೋಪುರ` ಮತ್ತು ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ 'ವಿಮಾನ' ಶಿಖರಗಳಿವೆ. ಏಳು ಅಂತಸ್ತುಗಳ ಗೋಪುರ 19ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದು ಪಿರಮಿಡ್ ಆಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ದ್ರಾವಿಡ ಶೈಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿತವಾಗಿದೆ. ಶಿಖರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಏಳು ಚಿನ್ನದ ಲೇಪಿತ ಕಲಶಗಳಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಹಿಷಮರ್ಧಿನಿಯಾದ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ವಿರಾಜಮಾನವಾಗಿದೆ. ಎಂಟು ಭುಜಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸೀನಳಾಗಿದ್ದಾಳೆ. ಈ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಪುರಾತನವಾದದ್ದು. ಈ ಶಿಲಾಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಮಾರ್ಖಂಡೇಯ ಋಷಿಗಳು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿದರೆಂದು ಸ್ಥಳ ಪುರಾಣ ಹೇಳುತ್ತದೆ. 1827 ರಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜಒಡೆಯರು ಸಾವಿರ ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೂ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಹಿನ್ನಲೆಯಿರುವ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಜೀರ್ಣೋಧ್ದಾರ ಮಾಡಿ ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಈ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಗೋಪುರವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಸಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹವಾಹನ' ಒಂದನ್ನು ಮರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸಿ ಕೊಡುಗೆ ನೀಡಿದರು. 'ಸಿಂಹ ವಾಹನ' ವನ್ನು ರಥೋತ್ಸವ ಸಂಧರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಸಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವಿಯ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನಿಟ್ಟು ರಥವನ್ನು ಎಳೆಯಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ದ್ವಾರದ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ಗಣಪತಿಯ ವಿಗ್ರಹವನ್ನು ನೋಡಬಹುದು. ದ್ವಾರದ ಬೃಹತ್ ಮರದ ಬಾಗಿಲನ್ನು ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ತಗಡಿನಿಂದ ಹೊದಿಸಲಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ಬಾಗಿಲಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಹಲವು ಸ್ವರೂಪಗಳನ್ನು ತೋರಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದ ಕೆಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಂದ್ರಾದಿ ಅಷ್ಠದಿಕ್ಪಾಲಕರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ.
ಮಹಾದ್ವಾರದಿಂದ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋದರೆ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಸಣ್ಣ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ. ವಿಘ್ನರಾಜನಿಗೆ ನಮಿಸಿ ಕೆಲವು ಕಲ್ಲಿನ ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಹತ್ತಿಹೋದರೆ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಬಲಿಪೀಠ ಮತ್ತು ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭ ಕಂಡುಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಬಲಿಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ದೇವಿಯ ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇವೆರಡರ ಮುಂಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಅಭಿಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಸಣ್ಣದೊಂದು ನಂದಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದೆ. ಮಾತೆ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯನ್ನು ಅದು ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸುತ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿದೆ. ಧ್ವಜ ಸ್ಥಂಭಕ್ಕೆ ಈಶಾನ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಗೋಡೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಆಂಜನೇಯನ ವಿಗ್ರಹವಿದ್ದು ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ನಿತ್ಯ ಪೂಜೆ ಜರುಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ದ್ವಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಂದಿನಿ ಮತ್ತು ಕಮಲಿನಿ ಎಂಬ ದ್ವಾರಪಾಲಿಕೆಯರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳು ದ್ವಾರದ ಎಡ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿವೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಗೆ ಮುಂಚೆ ಇರುವ ಅತರಾಳದ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುದ್ದಾದ ಗಣಪಡತಿ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಮತ್ತು ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳಿವೆ. ಭೈರವ ದೇವರ ಎಡಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಚಾಮುಂಡಿಯ ಪಂಚಲೋಹದ ಸುಂದರ ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯಿದೆ. ಗಣಪತಿಯ ಬಲಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಕ್ತನ ದಿರಿಸು ತೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಮುಮ್ಮಡಿ ಕೃಷ್ಣರಾಜ ಒಡೆಯರ ಆರು ಅಡಿ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸುಂದರ ಭಕ್ತ ವಿಗ್ರಹ ಕಾಣಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರು ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂವರು ಪತ್ನಿಯರೊಂದಿಗೆ ದೇವಿಗೆ ಕೈಮುಗಿದು ನಿಂತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮಹಾರಾಜರ ಎಡಭಾಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂತಿರುವವರೆಂದರೆ ರಮಾವಿಲಾಸ, ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿವಿಲಾಸ ಮತ್ತು ಕೃಷ್ಣವಿಲಾಸ ಮಹಾರಾಣಿಯರು. ಇವರುಗಳ ಶಿಲಾ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳ ಪಾದದ ಬಳಿಯ ಪೀಠದ ಮೇಲೆ ಇವರುಗಳ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನು ಕೆತ್ತಲಾಗಿದೆ.
ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಅರ್ಚಕರು ತಾಯಿ ಸ್ವರೂಪದ ಶಿಲಾ ಪ್ರತಿಮೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿ ದಿನ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಿ ಪೂಜೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಯದುಕುಲದ ದೇವತೆಯಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆದು ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿಗೆ ಮೈಸೂರಿನ ಮಹಾರಾಜರುಗಳು ಹಲವಾರು ಬೆಲೆಬಾಳುವ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಪರೂಪವಾದ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಶ್ರಧ್ಧಾಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಒಪ್ಪಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈ ಶಕ್ತಿ ದೇವತೆಗೆ ಮಾನವ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಬಲಿಯನ್ನು ಹಿಂದೆ ಕೊಡಲಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ 18ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಡಿವಾಣ ಬಿತ್ತು. ಈಗೇನಿದ್ದರೂ ಫಲಪುಷ್ಪಗಳ ಅರ್ಚನೆ, ಹಣ್ಣು ಹೂವು ಸಮರ್ಪಣೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮಾಡಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
ಗರ್ಭಗುಡಿಯ ಮೇಲ್ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಗೋಪುರ ಕಂಡು ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ದೇವಾಲಯದ ಹೊರಗಿನಿಂದ 'ವಿಮಾನವನ್ನು' ಕಾಣಬಹುದು. ಒಳ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಲವು ಸಣ್ಣ ಮೂರ್ತಿಗಳಿದ್ದು ಅಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಪೂಜೆ ಪುನಸ್ಕಾರಗಳು ಜರುಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಪ್ರಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣೆ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಿಂದ ಹೊರಹೋಗುವಾಗ ಶ್ರೀ ಆಂಜನೇಯಸ್ವಾಮಿ ದೇವರ ದರ್ಶನವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events5/banners/9deb7021b536467d2011eecf45d4a0028a83cab1860b24612033faefe884c1f8-rimg-w768-h960-gmir.jpg?v=1654287957",12.910,""

Moja propozycja to  Kerala w terminie 29 października -12 listopada 2022. Właściwie powinnam napisać \"nasza\" bo tym razem łączę  siły i miłość do Indii z cudowną Kasią Chustecką, która również od lat prowadzi wyjazdy do Azji i która zabierze was w świat hatha jogi. Więcej o Kasi (i o mnie też) na końcu opisu.

Plan jest taki: koncentrujemy się wyłącznie na Kerali. Odwiedzimy 5 cudownych miejsc, każde o wyjątkowym krajobrazie. 
Zaczniemy od pobytu na małej wyspie Vipin. Palmy, ocean, zabiegi Ayurvedy, wyśmienita kuchnia keralska i bardzo serdeczni mieszkańcy sprawią, że szybko poczujecie klimat Indii. 
Dalej odwiedzimy Fort Kochi, gdzie pośród gwarnych ulic pełnych sklepików z pamiątkami i przyprawami czuć nadal dawną świetność jednego z najważniejszych portów przeładunkowych Indii.  
Kolejny przystanek to położony na wys. 1600 m Munnar - rześkie górskie powietrze, herbaciane wzgórza i zapierające dech w piersiach widoki.  
Z Munnar wracamy na wybrzeże. Zabierzemy was na rejs po słynnych rozlewiskach Kerali. Ten wodny labirynt składa się z ponad 900 km dróg wodnych, jezior i kanałów. Nasz ostatni przystanek to Varkala. Czerwone klify , malownicze zachody słońca nad oceanem, sklepy z czym dusza zapragnie,  więcej Ayruvedy i relaksu.  Zapraszamy!

JOGA codzienne - sesja ok. 2 h. Zajęcia będą odbywały się rano (najczęściej), lub po południu.

JOGA, którą będziemy praktykować, to uważna metoda opracowana przez B.K.S Iyengara, w której duże znaczenie ma precyzja i stabilność pozycji, oraz dbałość o właściwe wykonanie ćwiczeń. Dzięki praktyce jogi powraca do ciała witalność i zdrowie. Napięcia blokujące przypływ energii są usuwane. Pojawia się poczucie lekkości, a zarazem mocy. Ćwiczymy dbając o stały przepływ oddechu, dzięki czemu również umysł wycisza się i uspokaja.  Zajęcia będą dostosowane do możliwości grupy. Wcześniejsze  doświadczenie nie jest konieczne, ale mile widziane. Będziemy praktykować też pranajamę (ćwiczenia oddechowe) oraz proste techniki medytacji.
 
Szczegółowy plan wyjazdu:

Dzień 1 (29.10) Wylot z Polski 

Dzień 2 (30.10) Przylot do Delhi. Przesiadka na lokalny przelot Delhi-Cochin. Transfer z lotniska Cochin do hotelu na wyspie Vipin (ok 1h drogi od lotniska). Relaks po podróży. Wspólne wyjście do restauracji. Omówimy pierwsze wrażenia zajadając się tradycyjnymi potrawami regionu. 

Dzień 3 (31.10) Aklimatyzacja, joga. Masaże i zabiegi Ayurvedy. Wypoczynek, plaża, zwiedzamy okolicę. Jeśli znajdzie się czas, Kasia poprowadzi wykład o podstawach Ayurvedy, jeśli nie, to w inny dzień. 

Dzień 4 (1.11) Wyjazd do Fort Kochi. Płyniemy promem z wyspy na główny ląd. Spacer portem, pozostałości po Portugalczykach, Holendrach i Brytyjczykach, chińskie sieci rybackie, miasteczko żydowskie i synagoga. Ogarnie nas zapewne szał zakupów, więc powrót na wyspę wieczorem. 

Dzień 5 (2.11) Joga. Ayurveda. Wspólna medytacja. Czas wolny, relaks. 

Dzień 6 (3.11) Pakowanie. Śniadanie. Dziś czeka nas niezapomniana podróż do Munnar. Sześciogodzinna podróż autobusem to przygoda sama w sobie :) Lunch w przydrożnej knajpce. Po przyjeździe do hotelu spacer i kolacja. 

Dzień 7 (4.11) Zwiedzamy plantacje herbaty, najpiękniejsze punkty widokowe  i wodospad. 

Dzień 8 (5.11)  Dziś dzień luźny. Po porannej praktyce można na przykład udać się do 'centrum' Munnar. Przechadzka po bazarze, gdzie sprzedawcy oferują między innymi herbatę, przyprawy i lokalną czekoladę . Można też odwiedzić świątynie i poobserwować lokalne rytuały.

Dzień 9 (6.11) Wracamy autobusem do Allapey, gdzie zaokrętujemy się na statek zwany \"houseboat\", czyli nasz hotel przez następne dwie noce. Powolny rejs statkiem po rozlewiskach \"backwaters\" to idealny czas na relaks po dotychczasowych wrażeniach. 

Dzień 10 (7.11) Oprócz codziennej jogi, Kasia poprowadzi pogadankę o filozofii jogi. W zależności od godzin posiłków wybierzemy czas na wspólną medytację. 

Dzień 11 (8.11) Ok 11 rano dobijamy do brzegu.  Kolejny przystanek to Varkala oddalona o 4 h drogi wzdłuż wybrzeża. Lunch w przydrożnej knjapce. Po przyjeździe do hotelu relaks. Wieczorem plaża i zachód słońca nad oceanem. 

Dzień 12 (9.11) Oprócz słynnych czerwonych klifów Varkala oferuje turystom praktycznie wszystko :) Zabiegi Ayurvedy na każdej ulicy, restauracje dla bogatych i dla tych ze skromniejszym portfelem, bazaar z różnościami z całych Indii. 

Dzień 13 (10.11) Dzień luźny. Dla chętnych spacer po okolicznych plażach. Przy odrobinie szczęścia możemy natrafić na rybaków przy pracy. Wieczorem wybierzemy się na występ taneczny Kathakali z widowiskowymi maskami i kostiumami. 

Dzień 14 (11.11) Przejazd porannym pociągiem do Cochin. Przejazd ze stacji na lotnisko krajowe i lot do Delhi.  Ostatnie zakupy i kolacja na ulicy, w najlepszym vege grillu, jaki jedliście w życiu :) 

Dzień 15 (12.11) Transfer na lotnisko. Wylot do Warszawy. Tego samego dnia jesteście w Warszawie. 

Kto jedzie z nami: 
Zapraszamy wszystkich :) Ważna jest otwartość i elastyczność. Miłośnicy przygód, interakcji z nowymi kulturami i ludźmi. W Indiach działa powiedzenie \"najlepszy plan to brak planu\". I tu nie zrozumcie mnie źle, my plan mamy, ale moc Indii z pewnością będzie nas testować przy jego realizacji.  Wyjazd nie wymaga specjalnej sprawności fizycznej ani wcześniejszego doświadczenia w jodze. Zajęcia będą dostosowane do możliwości uczestników. 

Minimalna wielkość grupy to 10 osób

Co zabieramy:
Choć w Indiach oficjalnie jest zima temperatury w lutym na południu są dosyć wysokie: ok. 30-35 stopni w dzień i ok. 20 stopni w nocy. 
Wygodne sandały/klapki, wygodne buty do chodzenia. Sukienki, spódnice, krótkie spodnie. Poruszamy się w rejonach turystycznych. Nikogo nie dziwią już odsłonięte ramiona czy nogi. Do zwiedzania świątyń przyda się chusta lub szal. Krem przeciwsłoneczny, coś na komary.  Polecam spakować się lekko. Limit bagażu w lokalnym przelocie to 15kg +7kg i na pewno zrobicie jakieś zakupy:) 

DO JOGI: proszę zabrać matę i pasek (do jogi). Maty lekkie, najlepiej takie składane, aby zajęłu jak najmniej miejsca. Pasek do jogi z klamerką, długości min. 1,75 m można kupić w internetowych sklepach z pomocami do jogi.

O nas: 
KATARZYNA CHUSTECKA - jestem nauczycielką jogi od 14 lat, praktykuję jogę wg metody BKS Iyengara od 20 lat. Założyłam i przez wiele lat prowadziłam Equanimus  - Ośrodek Dobrych Praktyk Radzenie Sobie ze Stresem - na moim rodzinnym warszawskim Wilanowie, gdzie uczyłam jogi i medytacji. Jestem podróżniczką, ale moje serce skradło Bali i tu zamieszkałam na stałe. Od wielu lat organizuję wyprawy z jogą do Indii oraz na Bali. Mam dwie córki. Z wykształcenia jestem socjologiem. Pasjonuję się ajurwedą.  Jestem wolnym ptakiem, podążąm za porywami serca, a w to co robię, wkładam całą duszę. 

MARTA GOŁUCHOWSKA - od 11 od mieszkam w Indiach. Przez 8 lat moim domem były Himalaje gdzie prowadziłam wegetariańską knajpkę dla turystów. W Himalajach urodził się mój syn. Na prośbę kilku znajomych zorganizowałam mój pierwszy wyjazd do Indii w 2010. Od tamtego czasu robię wyjazdy mniejsze i większe w różne miejsca Indii. Od niedawna mieszakm na Goa gdzie pomiędzy wyjazdami robię wegańskie ciasta dla lokalnych restauracji. Skończyłam Turystykę Miedzynarodową w UK i moim marzeniem po studiach było przejechać cały świat. Po wylądowaniu w Indiach niemal natychmiast pewne było  ze ja już nigdzie w najblizszym czasie nie pojadę. \"Jestem w domu\" ...to była pierwsza myśl.","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events7/banners/80f18a41861aaf95cd9759e1815887d630e7310161ce834a8a8bb5d18668668b-rimg-w960-h647-gmir.jpg?v=1656035548",17.560,"health-wellness"

Amol Palekar is back after 25 years into theatre for Kusur (A Theatrical Reading) presented by Goonjan, adapted from the Danish Thriller film Den Skyldige, to be performed for a limited period only. Watch the legend perform a thriller, a never seen ever before experience; for the first and last time in Kolkata.


It all begins on a rainy night... when retired Assistant Police Commissioner ASHOK DANDAVATE volunteers his service at a police control room. As the hours go by, anonymous residents of Mumbai seeks help.  With a trail coming up the next day, he gets a call from a woman who he believes has been kidnapped and despite being warned  not to get too emotionally involved, that's what exactly he does. The night presents us with a series of twist and turns, while the end unearths the truth in a way that leaves us holding our breath. 


When DANDAVATE exits the control room, he says, \" I'm indebted to this night.. Good intentions alone don't absolve us of our sins. Thank you Kaveri for helping me realise this.\"


The taut plot with its excuisite setting gradually unravels the mystery. The elaborate sound design is a character in itself, disturbing our complacency and overturning our assumptions. While excavating the rich subtext, the audience isn't permitted to be a mere distant, passive onlooker.


The Mistake takes us on a claustrophobic and thrilling, yet emotional and impressive journey. The theatrical reading experience is one to linger on, way beyond the curtain drop.


A one time chance to watch Amol Palekar perform the thriller reading live, and live the old memories...","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events5/banners/547471d550bf5482175584c5659bc7d7c0ca4a2a8138f534fa670452a8d5bda4-rimg-w594-h360-gmir.jpg?v=1655965956",62.230,"art,theatre,trips-adventures,entertainment"

Salman U. Syed founded Bangalore Open Air with the sole purpose of giving metalheads all over India a metal festival they can call their own. After tirelessly working with the world renowned Wacken Open Air Festival from Germany, BOA managed to forge a collaboration that has seen some of the most legendary and cutting edge metal acts grace Indian soil. From thrash titans Kreator and Destruction, to legendary heavy metal stalwarts Iced Earth and extreme metal luminaries like Rotting Christ and Vader, Bangalore Open Air has never failed to pull out all the stops when it comes to booking some of metal's most sought after acts. 

With an annual attendance of three thousand people that grows considerably with every passing year, and a state of the art festival experience that is on par with the best that Europe has to offer, it comes as no surprise that Bangalore Open Air is widely considered by metal fans all over the country as THE metal festival to head to every single year.

If we want Hindu unity, we need a known/fixed common place and time where many of us can gather in devotion.   From such regular gatherings, many good collaborations may manifest, and better mutual understanding, cooperation &amp; collaboration will evolve.  

For these 2 festivals to manifest annually, there is no need for any complicated meetings / joint committees to be made, nor for any new organizations to be registered, nor complex resolutions drafted...

www.bit.ly/HinduUnity  &amp;  www.bit.ly/HindusUnited

For its success, the only things we Hindus need to agree upon are:-

A.   Collectively accept that the Holy Gita is worshippable and so is Her divine author Mahamuni Sri Vyasadeva (BG 18:75)

B.   Collectively accept that these 2 Tithis are very auspicious:- 

i) the Birth Tithi of the Gita (universally celebrated as Gita Jayanti - it falls on Mokshada Ekadasi, Shukla Paksha, Marga Sirsha month) 
and
ii) the Birth Tithi of Sri Vyasadeva, which is universally celebrated as Guru Purnima - it falls on the Full Moon Day in the month of Ashadha

&amp;

C.  Collectively accept as Holy Pilgrim places (Tirthas) Kurukshetra &amp;  the Angkor Wat [Largest temple in the world.]


If we can all accept the above without debate, 
then the only thing we need to do 
to achieve this powerful unity is 
to just go ahead and 
BOOK OUR TICKETS** TO TRAVEL THERE!!!!  

If families, groups or organizations want to come, they can organize their own events there - just synchronize them:  Same Place, Same Time - www.bit.ly/GJIEVENTS

As more and more yatris (pilgrims) gather
at these two Gigantic Tirthas year after year, 
naturally, it will become easier and easier 
for all those involved in promoting Hindu Unity 
to collaborate for joint activities
and thus share their resources, 
synergize and act in unison 
for the greater good of mankind
wherever possible.

How can there possibly be any objection to this?   I doubt it.   Come, with joy let us all wholeheartedly worship and reverberate the holy sound vibration known as the Bhagavad Gita!

If we want Hindu unity, we need a known/fixed common place and time where many of us can gather in devotion.   From such regular gatherings, many good collaborations may manifest, and better mutual understanding, cooperation &amp; collaboration will evolve.  

For these 2 festivals to manifest annually, there is no need for any complicated meetings / joint committees to be made, nor for any new organizations to be registered, nor complex resolutions drafted...  No... it is soooo simple - just bring your own people and be there with your own program: Same Time &amp; Same Place.

Amol Palekar is back after 25 years into theatre for the play Kusur (The Mistake)- A Theatre Reading, adapted from the Danish Thriller film Den Skyldige, to be performed for a limited period only. Watch the legend perform a thriller, a never seen ever before experience; for the first and last time in Kolkata.


It all begins on a rainy night... when retired Assistant Police Commissioner ASHOK DANDAVATE volunteers his service at a police control room. As the hours go by, anonymous residents of Mumbai seeks help.  With a trail coming up the next day, he gets a call from a woman who he believes has been kidnapped and despite being warned  not to get too emotionally involved, that's what exactly he does. The night presents us with a series of twist and turns, while the end unearths the truth in a way that leaves us holding our breath. 


When DANDAVATE exits the control room, he says, \" I'm indebted to this night.. Good intentions alone don't absolve us of our sins. Thank you Kaveri for helping me realise this.\"


The taut plot with its excuisite setting gradually unravels the mystery. The elaborate sound design is a character in itself, disturbing our complacency and overturning our assumptions. While excavating the rich subtext, the audience isn't permitted to be a mere distant, passive onlooker.


The Mistake takes us on a claustrophobic and thrilling, yet emotional and impressive journey. The theatrical reading experience is one to linger on, way beyond the curtain drop.


A one time chance to watch Amol Palekar perform the thriller live, and live the old memories...","https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events8/banners/11213004277c4bad02727febd7604bb227334823b3afbf27ef11d1eae03b3cb2-rimg-w561-h546-gmir.jpg?v=1655811953",29.030,"art,theatre,trips-adventures,entertainment"

It is the third highest peak after Mullayanagiri and Bababudangiri. Absorb the beauty of the Western Ghats as you walk up the trail. Very few people know the fact that the Western Ghats are considered as UNESCO World Heritage Site for the natural beauty and for being an icon of environmental balance.

And finally, when you'll reach the peak, the picturesque view from the top and the chilled wind will absolutely blow you out of your mind and make you numb for a few minutes, before you regain your consciousness to feel the enchanting magic of the place. So if you are bored of the city lights in Bangalore, then forget everything and join us for this weekend trek to Kudremukh and find yourself amidst nature.</p><p><br /></p><p>Important Notice:</p><p>The Forest Department at Kudremukh allows only the first 50 persons (on first come first serve basis) to trek to the Kudremukh Peak in a day.
